On its transfer to the London County Council in 1906 the school was renamed Hackney Downs School (formerly the Grocers' Company's School).</p>\\n<h3>Grammar school</h3>\\n<p>As a grammar school, it won an excellent reputation, with alumni including Nobel prize-winning playwright the late Harold Pinter, fellow playwright and actor Steven Berkoff, 1960s tycoon John Bloom, and athletics administrator Sir Arthur Gold. Many famous medical men attended including kidney transplant pioneer Ralph Shackman and pioneering nutritionist John Yudkin. Four current members of the House of Lords are former pupils: (Lord Levy, Baron Peston, Lord Feldman, and Lord Clinton-Davis). It had 600 boys with a sixth-form entry by the early 1970s.</p>\\n<h3>Comprehensive</h3>\\n<p>In September 1974, it became a comprehensive school, and inherited more than its share of the problems of this deprived inner-city borough. It had voted to become comprehensive in 1969. Just before its closure, over 70 percent of the boys spoke English as a second language, half came from households with no-one in employment, and half the intake had reading ages three years below average.</p>\\n<h3>Decline and closure</h3>\\n<p>Things came to a head in the 1990s, when the school made national news by being described by the then Conservative government as the 'worst school in Britain'. Eventually, as a result of direct government pressure, the school was forced to close in 1995.</p>\\n<p>The decision remains controversial to this day, opponents of the closure pointing out that Hackney Downs was singled out for special treatment by the government (presumably <i>pour encourager les autres</i>) and that its academic results were not significantly worse than many other inner-city comprehensives, especially considering the problems it had inherited, including the steady 'decanting' of problem pupils\\u2014who had frequently been expelled from their original schools\\u2014to Hackney Downs.</p>\\n<h3>Later use of the building</h3>\\n<p>The site of the old school is now occupied by Mossbourne Community Academy, founded by Sir Clive Bourne, which opened in 2004.</p>\\n<p>While the school buildings of both the original Grocers' Company's School and Hackney Downs School have been replaced by the new Mossbourne Academy, the Old Boys of Hackney Downs continue their interactions as alumni through The Clove Club, which meets regularly, has its own website, and sponsors a very active email group called <i>The Clove eGroup</i> (on Yahoo), and featured on The Clove Club website.</p>\\n<h3>Histories of the School</h3>\\n<p>An official history of the school, written by the historian Professor Geoffrey Alderman (who was a pupil there 1955-62) was published by the Clove Club in 1972. In 2012 Alderman published an updated history: <i>Hackney Downs 1876-1995: The Life and Death of a School,</i> in which he took the story to the school's demise, using hitherto unpublished material.</p>\\n<h3>Headmasters</h3>\\n<ul><li>John Kemp 1974-89</li>\\n</ul><h2>Notable alumni</h2>\\n<h3>Hackney Downs School (1974-95)</h3>\\n<ul><li>Dalton Grant, high jumper</li>\\n</ul><h3>Boys' grammar school (1906-74)</h3>\\n<ul><li>Geoffrey Alderman, historian</li>\\n<li>Arnold Allen CBE, Chief Executive from 1982-4 of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)</li>\\n<li>Alexander Baron, writer</li>\\n<li>Morris Beckman</li>\\n<li>Steven Berkoff, actor, playwright, director</li>\\n<li>Prof Gerald Bernbaum, Vice-Chancellor from 1993-2001 of London South Bank University, and Professor of Education from 1974-93 at the University of Leicester</li>\\n<li>John Bloom, 1960s tycoon</li>\\n<li>Eric Bristow, World Champion darts player</li>\\n<li>Air Vice-Marshal Reggie Bullen CB GM</li>\\n<li>Sir Stanley Burnton, Lord Justice of Appeal and Fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford</li>\\n<li>Sir Michael Caine (Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, Jr.), CBE, actor (attended in 1944-1945, when he was evacuated to King's Lynn during World War II)</li>\\n<li>Roland Camberton, writer</li>\\n<li>Frank Cass, publisher</li>\\n<li>Stanley Clinton Davis, Baron Clinton-Davis, Labour MP from 1970-83 for Hackney Central</li>\\n<li>Ivor Compton, founder of the Hall of Cards chain which later merged with Hallmark Cards</li>\\n<li>Dr Paul Dean CB, Director from 1977-90 of the National Physical Laboratory</li>\\n<li>Prof Cyril Domb, physicist, Professor of Theoretical Physics from 1954-81 at King's College London</li>\\n<li>Maurice Evans (actor)</li>\\n<li>Basil Feldman, Baron Feldman</li>\\n<li>Frederic Sutherland Ferguson, bibliographer</li>\\n<li>Prof Maurice Freedman, Professor of Social Anthropology from 1970-5 at the University of Oxford</li>\\n<li>Abram Games OBE, graphic designer</li>\\n<li>Norman Ginsbury, playwright</li>\\n<li>Sir Arthur Gold CBE, Chairman from 1988-92 of the British Olympic Association</li>\\n<li>Dr Michael Goldstein CBE, Vice-Chancellor from 1992-2004 of Coventry University, and Director from 1987-1992 of Coventry Polytechnic</li>\\n<li>Arnold Goodman, Baron Goodman, Master from 1976-86 of University College, Oxford</li>\\n<li>Prof Douglas Gough, Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics since 1993 at the University of Cambridge, and Director from 1999-2004 of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge</li>\\n<li>Prof Abraham Guz, Professor of Medicine from 1981-94 at the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School</li>\\n<li>Efraim Halevy, former head of Mossad</li>\\n<li>Prof William Harold Hutt, economist, and Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty of Commerce from 1931-64 at the University of Cape Town</li>\\n<li>Frank Cyril James, Principal and Vice-Chancellor from 1939-62 of McGill University, Canada</li>\\n<li>Brigadier Sam Janikoun OBE</li>\\n<li>Maj-Gen Stanley Joslin CB CBE, Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations from 1959-64 at the Ministry of Power</li>\\n<li>Leon Kossoff, painter</li>\\n<li>Stephen Latner, Managing Director from 1998-9 of Warburg Dillon Read</li>\\n<li>Dr Gerald Levene, dermatologist</li>\\n<li>Michael Levy, Baron Levy</li>\\n<li>John Lewis, Labour MP from 1945-50 for Bolton and from 1950-1 for Bolton West</li>\\n<li>Sir Ben Lockspeiser, cancelled the ground-breaking Miles M.52 supersonic project (its important features later re-incarnated as the Bell X-1), and first President of CERN</li>\\n<li>Dennis Lyons CB, Director from 1965-71 of the Road Research Laboratory</li>\\n<li>Sir Leonard Millis CBE, Director from 1939-74 of the British Waterworks Association</li>\\n<li>Prof Cyril Offord, Professor of Mathematics from 1966-73 at the London School of Economics (LSE)</li>\\n<li>Stamley Orman, Director of Missiles from 1978-81 at the AWRE, and Chief Weapon System Engineer of Polaris from 1981-2</li>\\n<li>Fuller Osborn, (the first) Chief Executive from 1965-78 of Northern Rock Building Society</li>\\n<li>Jerry Pam, Hollywood Agent and Member of the Finance Committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; publicist of Sir Michael Caine</li>\\n<li>Prof Keith Pavitt, of the Science and Technology Policy Research</li>\\n<li>Maurice Peston, Baron Peston of Mile End, English economist, Professor of Economics from 1965-88 at Queen Mary College, and father of Robert Peston</li>\\n<li>Harold Pinter, CBE, CH, and 2005 Nobel Laureate (attended from 1944 to 1948; evacuated to Cornwall during World War II)</li>\\n<li>Lt Col F.

The parish church of St John-at-Hackney was built in 1789, replacing the nearby former 16th-century parish church dedicated to St Augustine (pulled down in 1798). The original tower of that church was retained to hold the bells until the new church could be strengthened; the bells were finally removed to the new St John's in 1854.

In 1894, the district and board were dissolved, with the Hackney vestry taking on its duties within the parish.</p>\\n<p>In 1889 Hackney was included in the new County of London, and in 1900 the vestry was dissolved with the parish becoming the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. The civil parish was abolished when the borough became part of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965.</p>\\n<p>The boundaries of the civil parish were identical to the ancient parish, and it covered 3,289 acres (13.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>).

The parish was divided into eight wards for elections.</p>\\n<p>The London Government Act 1899 replaced the incorporated vestries with borough councils consisting of a mayor, aldermen and councillors. All councillors were to be elected every three years. There was one alderman for every six councillors, and these were elected by the council itself.</p>\\n<p>Boundary commissioners were appointed under the London Government Act 1899 to divide the new boroughs into wards, and to apportion councillors to each ward. It was decided to continue to use the eight vestry wards. The Moderates claimed that Stamford Hill and West Hackney wards were under-represented and should be given nine councillors, with the remaining six wards having six each. In the event, the commissioners apportioned 60 councillors between the eight wards: Clapton Park, Hackney, Homerton and Stamford Hill having nine councillors and Downs, Kingsland, South and West wards having six a piece. With 10 aldermen, the borough council thus had 70 members.</p>\\n<h4>1900\\u20131919</h4>\\n<p>The boundary changes seem to have favoured the Moderates, as at the first elections to the council on 1 November 1900 they won a majority with 37 seats to 18 won by the Liberal Party and Progressives, with 3 independent Conservative and 2 independent councillors also returned. At the next election in 1903 the Progressives won control with 49 seats to 11 Conservatives. Three years later the Conservatives ran under the Municipal Reform label. Municipal Reformers won 18 seats and independents supported by them won 20, giving them a majority over the Progressives with 22 seats. The Progressives regained the council in 1909 with a narrow majority, losing power to the Municipal Reform party again in 1912.</p>\\n<h4>1919\\u20131937</h4>\\n<p>The next elections, postponed until 1919 due to the First World War, were won by the Labour Party: Labour won 32 seats, Municipal Reform 15 and Progressives 13. At the next elections in 1922 a \\\"Progressive Reform\\\" anti-Labour alliance won all seats on the council, and held them at the subsequent polls in 1925. The 1928 election was partly run on party lines: the Municipal Reform party won control with 31 seats, other Anti-Labour candidates won 15, Labour won 12 and Progressives 1. In 1931 Municipal Reformers won all but one seat, which was held by Labour. Labour gained control of the borough council in 1934, and held power for the rest of the borough's existence. In 1934 they won 45 seats to 15 won by Municipal Reformers.</p>\\n<h4>1937\\u20131965</h4>\\n<p>In 1937 the borough's ward boundaries were redrawn: sixteen wards were created (Chatham, Culford, Dalston, Downs, Graham, Leaside, Marsh, Maury, Park, Ridley, Southwold, Springfield, Stamford, Town Hall, Tudor and Wick), each represented by three councillors. To the forty-eight councillors thus elected were added 8 aldermen. Labour won 41 seats in 1937 to Municipal Reform's 7. Local elections were postponed due to the Second World War, and from 1945 the only non-Labour councillors were Communists: 1 was elected in 1945, and 2 in 1949. At the last four elections to the council in 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1962 Labour won all the seats.</p>\\n<h3>Coat of arms</h3>\\n<p>The seal of the Hackney Vestry bore a representation of St Augustine's Tower, the remains of the 13th-century parish church. When the metropolitan borough was formed in 1900, the vestry seal was altered by the addition of the Latin motto <i>Justitia Turris Nostra</i> or <i>Justice is our tower</i>.</p>\\n<p>In January 1924 the borough council resolved to seek a formal grant of armorial bearings from the College of Arms. These were duly made by letters patent dated 31 May 1924. The arms were blazoned as follows:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Per fesse, the chief per pale gules and per fesse Sable and Argent, and the base barry wavy of six Argent and Azure, in the dexter chief a representation of the Hackney Tower proper and in the sinister chief a Maltese Cross per fesse Argent and Gules.<br>\\nCrest: On a Wreath of the Colours a representation of the Hackney Tower Or.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The \\\"Hackney Tower\\\" appeared in the upper portion of the shield, and formed the crest, placed on a helm and mantling. The 1900 motto was also retained. The Maltese Cross represented the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller. These orders successively held the manor of Hackney, until the Reformation. The Templars wore red crosses on white mantles, and the Hospitallers white crosses on black: these were combined in the design. The wavy white and blue bars at the base of the shield represented the River Lea and the many canals crossing the borough.</p>\\n<p>These arms gave much inspiration to the coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney when the London borough was created in 1965.</p>\\n<h3>Town hall</h3>\\n\\n<p>The borough council was initially based in a \\\"French-Italian\\\" style town hall in Hackney Grove, dating from 1866. The building was extended in 1898. A new Art Deco town hall in Mare Street was begun in 1934, and opened in 1937. It is now the headquarters of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p><br clear=\\\"all\\\"></p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>London Government Act 1899</li>\\n<li>Metropolis Management Act 1855</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li>Robert Donald, ed.

It is protected by Acts of Parliament as a London Square. It is dominated by the Church of St John-at-Hackney built in 1792-97, and St John\\u2019s Gardens. Its made up of listed late Georgian terraces on Clapton Square. More of these terraces can be found on the south side of Sutton Place (once home to Colin Firth) and pairs of early mid-nineteenth-century houses to the north.</p>\\n<p>Clapton Square has a charming village feel, and five-storey houses with their original leaded fanlights above the doors, pilasters and roof cornicing. Their sash windows, ornamental cast-iron balconies, six panelled doors, columns and porches make them easily as impressive as any Grade II listed Georgian property in smarter south-west London, and many have stunning views of the church. Clapton Square, with its ivy-clad frontages, was laid out on Clapton Field in 1816 and is still a pocket of greenery in this busy area. Two sides of the square were demolished in the late 19th century, so today Georgian houses are only on the north and west sides. The Rectory for St Johns was relocated to Clapton Square in 2006.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Square was laid out in 1816 by wealthy citizens such as brokers from the city in the style of West End Georgian squares and terraces. It has central gardens containing a finely restored drinking fountain donated to Hackney residents by Howard Morley Esq.in 1894. The east side of the square was destroyed by bombing in the Second World War but has now been rebuilt in Georgian style by Furlong Homes. Russian revolutionary Vladimir Illyich Lenin used to visit, around 1905, his friend and comrade Theodore Rothstein at a house on the west side. 19th century Jewish writer Grace Aguilar also lived in the Square. To the north-east of the square is Holly Villas in Clapton Passage which is a fine terrace of bay-windowed Victorian villas of 1882.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\u2018On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before\\u2019 wrote Joseph Priestley one of England\\u2019s greatest scientists who lived at a house in the 1790s (demolished in 1880) on the corner of the Passage and Lower Clapton Road. He was hounded out of his house and laboratory in Birmingham by a mob that opposed his support for the French Revolution. He was invited to come to Hackney to take up the post of Unitarian Minister at the Old Gravel Pit Chapel where he had many friends amongst the Hackney Dissenters. A plaque marks the site of his house above the existing corner building in Lower Clapton Road. He emigrated to America in 1794 fearing a repeat of his family\\u2019s persecution.</p>\\n<p>In a cottage behind Priestley\\u2019s house, in the closing years of the 18th century, lived a Huguenot widow called Louisa Perina Courtauld, a designer of gold plate who married Samuel Courtauld (goldsmith). Their son, Samuel Courtauld, founded the Courtauld dynasty of silk and artificial fibre manufacturers and a descendant founded the Courtauld Institute now in Somerset House.</p>\\n\\n<p>Clapton Square is situated near the centre of the London Borough of Hackney, at the junction of the historic north-south thoroughfares of Lower Clapton Road and Mare Street and the east-west route of Dalston Lane and Homerton High Street (Figure 1). The land slopes gently down from the north to the southern portion of the Conservation Area. Most of the Area is situated on the Hackney Gravels geological terrace created by the once wider River Thames. The Conservation Area is split amongst Chatham, Dalston, East Down and Lea Bridge Wards, and has approximately 250 dwellings yielding a population of some 1,000 people.</p>\\n<p>The Conservation Area contains two significant open spaces, Clapton Square and the Churchyard of St. John-at-Hackney, known as St. John's Gardens, an L-shaped green area with good footpaths. The serpentine form of Lower Clapton Road (together with the partly pedestrianised stretch of Mare Street, a busy shopping district) is a distinctive feature of the Area, generating a good sequence of views.</p>\\n\\n<p>The plague in 1665 and the Great Fire of London the following year did a great deal to make country life more appealing to affluent urbanites and this trend continued in the Georgian period. Daniel Defoe, who lived in Stoke Newington, described Hackney in the 1720s as comprising \\\"twelve hamlets\\\" and \\\"having so many rich citizens that it contained nearly a hundred coaches\\\". Important Hackney residents included the Governor of the Bank of England, who lived in Hackney House, Clapton in 1745 and the chief founder of the Honourable East India Company.</p>\\n\\n<p>Georgian streets have a uniformity, due to the regulations of the London Building Act of 1774. Known as the Black Act because of its impositions, it was passed in response to the Great Fire and stipulated amongst other things that houses should be brick, windows recessed and that roofs should be slate and should not overhang. Ironically it is these rigid building regulations so resented at the time that have contributed to the Georgian house being so sought after today.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are significant historic buildings around Clapton Square, ranging from the medieval St Augustine's Tower Hackney the Tudor period Sutton House, the neo-classical Church of St John-at-Hackney, and the High Victorian Round Chapel all of them listed buildings and significant local landmarks.</p>\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Hackney Conservation Zones</li>\\n<li>History, development and archeology of Clapton Square</li>\\n<li>Clapton Square on Hackney's Conservation Zone walk</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":10000,\"dist\":614.9,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":9299024,\"title\":\"Zelda Kahan\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Zelda Kahan</b> (1886 &#8211; 1969) was a British communist.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q8068706\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0},{\"pageid\":36936830,\"title\":\"Raz Olsher\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Raz Olsher</b> is a London based music producer, song writer and composer.

It comprises the area roughly surrounding, and extending north from Mare Street. It is situated 4 miles (6.4\\u00a0km) north east of Charing Cross. It is also the name of Hackney Central ward, an electoral division for Hackney Council.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Central is the area that once would have been known as <b>Hackney Village</b>. This was a place that flourished from the Tudor period, when principal members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area, and King Henry VIII of England had a palace (located near the modern Lee Bridge Road roundabout). Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners until the end of the Georgian era, when this suburb of London began to be completely built up. Railways, trams and factories brought an end to Hackney's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era, and its fortunes declined.</p>\\n<p>The industries of nearby Homerton and the Lee Valley have largely disappeared, leaving the NHS and local council as the largest employers. Successive waves of immigrants, both from abroad and within the United Kingdom, make modern Hackney a culturally vibrant part of inner London, with both the benefits and challenges that this brings.</p>\\n<p>Extensive post-war redevelopment has replaced much of the housing stock, but the Georgian housing and Victorian terraces that remain have become popular again.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>In 1727, Daniel Defoe said of the villages of Hackney</p>\\n<h3>Early origins</h3>\\n<p>Central Hackney was largely unchanged by Roman times, with Ermine Street passing to the west. The land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay in the Catevallauni tribal territory.</p>\\n<p>The name Hackney derives from a 5th or 6th century Saxon settlement known as <i>Haca's ey</i> \\u2013 or raised ground in marshland. This was due to the proximity of Hackney Brook, and was probably located on the higher ground around the later St Augustine's Tower. Hackney is not specifically mentioned in the Norman Domesday Book, as at that time it formed a part of the manor of Stepney.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor village</h3>\\n<p>Little remains of early Hackney, except the Tudor St Augustine's Tower, which survives as Hackney's oldest building; and the positively medieval road network. The churchyard, Hackney Brook, and the surrounding villages prevented Hackney's expansion, and by 1605 the village had a lower rateable value than the other divisions of the parish. In Tudor times, there were a number of fine houses along Church Street, but many Tudor courtiers lived in nearby Homerton. On the site of Brooke House college, in Clopton was sited one of Henry VIII's palaces, where his daughter Mary took the Oath of Supremacy. Her guardian was a Bryck Place Homerton resident, Ralph Sadleir who was also Henry's Principal Secretary of State.</p>\\n<p>A further cluster of houses existed in medieval times, where Well Street enters Mare Street. It was on open ground, to the north-east of here that the Loddiges family founded their extensive nursery business in the 18th century.</p>\\n<h3>Georgian period</h3>\\n<p>By 1724, while still consisting of a single street, there is an unbroken line of buildings, except by the churchyard and by the brook, with large gardens behind for the finer houses and inns. The 16th-century church, despite galleries being installed, became too small for the needs of the parish, and parliament was petitioned in 1790 for a modern larger church to be built. This began in 1791 on a field to the north east of the old church, but was bedeviled by builders' bankruptcies and not finally completed until 1812\\u201313 when the tower and porches were added. Further disaster struck in a fire of 1955.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the churchyard stands the tomb of Francis Beaufort, devisor of the Beaufort scale; and that of John Hunter, the second governor of New South Wales. The Loddiges family also has a tomb in the churchyard, and memorials within the church. The parish burial register records the death of <i>Anthony, a poore old negro, aged 105</i> in 1630. This is all that is known of Anthony, but he is the first recorded Black resident of Hackney.</p>\\n\\n<p>The villages of Hackney, Lower Clapton and Homerton remained separated by fields into the 19th century. The fine houses remained, with large gardens behind. Artisans and labourers lived in cottages established in these gardens. There was not the room, or the will, for major rebuilding in the village. By 1800, St Thomas' Square, a Georgian square was laid out on the southern end of Mare Street. By the 20th century, these buildings had declined and were replaced with public housing. An early 18th-century mansion, now the <i>New Landsdown Club</i>, but once the headquarters of Elizabeth Fry's <i>British Ladies' Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners</i> remains at 195 Mare Street. It is Grade II* listed, but in poor condition and on the English Heritage register of buildings at risk. In neighbouring Homerton, (to the east of the churchyard) Sutton Place was built by 1806, near to Sutton House.</p>\\n<p>The rebuilding of the Church, on a field to the north of the village altered the course of the road and allowed the establishment of Clapton Square in 1816, in nearby Lower Clapton. Much of the area to the north and east of the churchyard now forms the <i>Clapton Square Conservation Area</i>, designated in 1969.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian Hackney</h3>\\n\\n<p>During the Victorian era, many of the old buildings were swept away and the estates broken up to form streets of terraced housing. The change from rural suburb to firmly urban, was marked by the arrival of the railway in 1850, with a great iron rail bridge crossing Mare Street. Trams began to make their appearance on the streets in the 1870s, and a tram depot opened in 1882 on Bohemia Place.</p>\\n<p>Increased access and the culverting of Hackney Brook in 1859\\u201360, brought about the present road layout. Many older buildings were pulled down to intensify development and to make room for street widening and the railway. In 1802, The Old Town Hall was built on the site of the vestry house, by the tower. This was re-fronted in a <i>baroque</i> style in 1900. In turn, this building was replaced as being too small for the needs of the borough, the political centre moving to the front of today's Town Hall (1937). By the turn of the 20th century, only St Johns Gardens, and Clapton Square, the areas around the 1791 church, remained as public open space.</p>\\n<h2>Governance</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Hackney Central is the conventional geographical core of Hackney, and in fact, before the 1899 London County Council reorganisation, it was what many would have understood to <i>be</i> Hackney, although the term <i>Hackney Proper</i> was often used to distinguish it from other local settlements such as South Hackney, West Hackney and Hackney Wick.</p>\\n<p>However, in terms of parish boundaries, up until 1835 the areas of <i>Hackney Proper</i>, Homerton, Upper and Lower Clapton, Dalston, De Beauvoir Town, Stamford Hill, and Kingsland all constituted the Parish of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Since then, the term has been vastly extended to mean, firstly the 1899 Metropolitan Borough, then, after 1965, the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Town Hall is about 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross; and 3.8 miles (6.1\\u00a0km) from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge.</p>\\n<h2>Landmarks</h2>\\n\\n<p>South of Hackney Central railway station Mare Street slices through Hackney's 'cultural quarter' of Town Hall Square. Its north side is dominated by Frank Matcham's Grade II* listed 1901 Hackney Empire music hall, on whose stage appeared Charles Chaplin and Marie Lloyd \\u2013 who lived in nearby Graham Road. On the west side of Town Hall Square is the 1934-7 Grade II Hackney Town Hall in Portland Stone, fronted by an open space created when its predecessor, the Hackney Vestry Hall of 1860 was demolished. A new town hall complex is being constructed behind the existing building. Opposite on the East side, is the 2001 refurbishment of the Central Library and Methodist Hall, combined to form the Ocean Music Venue.</p>\\n\\n<p>.</p>\\n<p>The square is completed by the 2002 Learning and Technology Centre. This houses the new Hackney Central Library, the Hackney Archive, the local museum and the offices of the Hackney Learning Trust.</p>\\n<p>The Clowns' archive and museum used to be housed behind the Town Hall. It relocated to the All Saints Centre, Haggerston around 2005; but the exhibition has since moved out of the borough to Wookey Hole.</p>\\n<p>North of the railway bridge, Mare Street continues as The Narroway (originally known as Church Street). By St Augustine's Tower, a Grade I landmark, is the 'Old Town Hall' built to serve the Parish of Hackney in 1802. It is now a betting shop. To the east are St Johns' Church Gardens. In 2009, they were awarded Heritage Green Flag status. Within the gardens stands the Church of St John-at-Hackney (built 1792).</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n\\n<p>The area is 2 miles (3.2\\u00a0km) north-east of the City of London with frequent trains from Hackney Downs railway station to Liverpool Street. Hackney Central railway station is a part of London Overground with westbound trains to Richmond, via Dalston Kingsland railway station and eastbound trains to Stratford, via Homerton railway station.</p>\\n<p>The existing connection to the Victoria line at Highbury and Islington tube station and Stratford railway station will be supplemented by a link to the extended East London line at Dalston.</p>\\n<p>The nearest London Overground station is <i>Hackney Central</i>.</p>\\n<h2>Economy</h2>\\n<p>The Narrow Way (<i>Church Street</i>) remains a busy shopping area, and there is a large Tesco supermarket in nearby Morning Lane (<i>Money Lane</i>). This international store group was founded in Hackney, from a market stall in Well Street market in 1919. A planning application for a multi-storey shopping centre (with parking beneath, and housing above) on the Hackney Tesco site was refused permission in 2010, and the future of the site remains uncertain. A former Burberry factory building is also located off Morning Lane, with a 'factory outlet' that is considered to be Hackney's most visited tourist attraction. This site is currently being redeveloped, in two phases, that will see the retention of the showroom, but add housing above.</p>\\n<p>The primary local employers are the council and the NHS at Homerton University Hospital; there are also two London Transport garages, one at the foot of the Narroway, and another about 1 mile south at Ash Grove. Between Ash Grove and London Fields there is a small industrial estate.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Schools in the area include The Urswick School (formerly known as Hackney Free and Parochial Church of England Secondary School).

It is situated 3.5 miles (5.6\\u00a0km) northeast of Charing Cross. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. Its historical borders are Kingsland Road and Kingsland High Street in the west, London Fields in the east, Downs Park Road in the north and the Shoreditch parish boundary in the south. Its main shopping street, Kingsland High Street, follows the route of the Roman Ermine Street, and has the road number A10. Modern Dalston is often seen as the area surrounding both sides of Kingsland High Street, even though some of the west side is within the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The name Dalston is thought to have derived from <i>Deorlaf's tun</i> (farm) in much the same way as nearby Hoxton was named after the farm of 'Hoch'.</p>\\n<p>The village was one of four small villages within the Parish of Hackney (along with Newington, Shacklewell, and Kingsland) that were grouped for assessment purposes, together having only as many houses as the village of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>John Rocque's map of 1746 shows the village of Kingsland centred on the crossroads at what is now Dalston Junction and the small village of Dalston further east along Dalston Lane.</p>\\n<p>Around AD 1280 a leper hospital was founded in Dalston by the citizens of London and in AD 1549 it was attached to the chapel of St Bartholomew as an outhouse.</p>\\n<p>During the 18th and 19th centuries the area changed from an agricultural and rural landscape to urban one. By 1849, it was described as <i>a recently increased suburban village, with some handsome old houses</i>, and by 1859 the village had exceeded its neighbour and, with the railways and continuous building, the village of Kingsland disappeared.</p>\\n<h2>Redevelopment</h2>\\n<p>The gentrification of the area has led to a rapid increase in the price of property. The process of change was accelerated by the East London line extension, now part of London Overground. The reopening of Dalston Junction Station on this extension was part of London's successful bid to hold the 2012 Olympics.</p>\\n<h2>Entertainment</h2>\\n\\n<p>Dalston has always been an important transport and shopping centre. It was also, at one time, an important entertainment centre, with four or five cinemas within a radius of a \\u2153 of a mile, and the Dalston Theatre, a former hippodrome and music hall that later became the <i>Four Aces blues club</i> and the <i>Labyrinth nightclub</i>. The Dalston Theatre was demolished in February 2007, despite an active local campaign to save it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Dalston was a hub for 1970s and 1980s pub rock venues but these are largely defunct. However the new Dalston Culture House, the first wing of which has opened on Gillett Square, hosts the Vortex Jazz Club, moved from Stoke Newington in 2005.</p>\\n<h2>Notable people</h2>\\n<ul><li>Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie shared a house on St Mark's Rise in Dalston in the early 1980s</li>\\n<li>Emily Lloyd, actress</li>\\n<li>Sir Charles James Martin, FRS, FRCS, director of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine</li>\\n<li>Alan Spenner- Bass player with The Grease Band and Roxy Music</li>\\n</ul><h2>Shopping</h2>\\n\\n<p>Established in the 1880s, Ridley Road Market is opposite Dalston Kingsland railway station. Fruit and vegetables, some fairly exotic, are available. Halal butchers cluster around the high street end of the market.</p>\\n<p>Ridley Road market is reputedly the basis for the one found in the BBC's <i>EastEnders</i>. The Kingsland Shopping Centre (formerly Dalston Cross) is just south of Ridley Road market. Kingsland Road and the surrounding streets are home to an ever-growing number of trendy boutiques, bars and caf\\u00e9s.</p>\\n<h2>Area profile</h2>\\n\\n<p>Contemporary Dalston is a lively neighbourhood with an ethnically varied population. Architecturally it is a mixture of 18th and 19th century terraced houses and 20th century council estates. It is currently undergoing rapid gentrification, partly because of the redevelopment of the railway station at Dalston Junction and partly due to the revitalisation of large parts of east London in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics. (Hackney was one of the four host boroughs of the Games).</p>\\n<p>Dalston has attracted immigrants for over 100 years; at the turn of the century it was a popular area for newly arrived Jewish people from central Europe. In the fifties and sixties, as the Jewish community became more affluent and moved out, they were replaced by a large Caribbean community, which accounts for the wide choice of Caribbean food available in Ridley Road. As the Caribbean community slowly drifted out of Dalston it then became popular with the Turkish, as well as the Vietnamese. Recent arrivals include Poles, judging by the numbers of Polish delicatessens now appearing and other stores catering to Polish tastes.</p>\\n<p>Fassett Square was the inspiration for the BBC soap <i>EastEnders</i>. Originally, there were plans to film the series there, on location. However, Fassett Square (Albert Square) and Ridley Road Market (Walford Market) were rebuilt on the set in Elstree, near Borehamwood, to have a more controlled filming environment. The idea of Walford stems from Walford Road, and many of the houses on the show use the same exterior design. Coincidentally both Barbara Windsor and Tony Holland, one of the original creators of the show, lived at different times on the street.</p>\\n<p>That is not the only connection with entertainment industry. Around the corner, music hall artist Marie Lloyd (1870\\u20131922) used to reside on Graham Road. The house now has a blue plaque.</p>\\n<p>In April 2009 The Guardian published an article on Dalston claiming that it was the \\\"coolest\\\" place to live in Britain. In the same year however, sculpture park The Towers of Hackney was torn down to give way to new buildings.</p>\\n<h2>Pop-culture references</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>The 2007 film <i>Run Fat Boy Run</i> (directed by David Schwimmer) was filmed in Dalston (St. Mark's Conservation Area).

Dr. Henry Newcome who gave the school its name was noted for Whig political principles, and a large number of future Members of Parliament were educated at Newcome's, which was in the Newcome family for three generations, to 1803. Distinguished pupils included Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, British Prime Minister from 1768-1770, and two Founding Fathers of the United States (Middleton and Nelson). The family descended from Henry Newcome, a prominent nonconformist minister in Manchester. His third son Peter was an Anglican priest, and the father of the Henry Newcome who gave the school its name.</p>\\n<p>The school closed in 1815, and the building was knocked down in 1820. In 1825 the London Orphan Asylum opened on the site. The <i>History of Parliament</i> (1820\\u20131832) comments that, even after its closure, the school could count nine Members of Parliament educated there in the period. It sent 42 pupils to Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>\\n<p>Today the Clapton Girls' Academy is located on the site.</p>\\n<h2>Drama</h2>\\n<p>Newcome's School was noted for a series of dramatic productions. In some case a prologue or epilogue was written specially. The school was one of a group that acted as preparatory schools to Westminster School; the dramatic tradition imitated Westminster's, with the difference that plays were in English (rather than Latin). One of the contributors of prologues was David Garrick. The custom of giving a play every three years was also taken over from the Elizabethan statutes of Westminster School.

London Fields received a Green Flag award in July 2008. A much-used cycle path runs from the <i>Pub on the Park</i> to Broadway Market. London Fields also has a railway station linking it to Hackney Downs and to Liverpool Street in the City. The Pub on the Park is the starting point for the annual Dunwich Dynamo night cycle ride.</p>\\n<p>Every Saturday, a wide variety of producers from around the country take part in the market, selling hot foods, hand-made jewellery, gifts, childrenswear and vintage clothing. Every Sunday, the local London Fields Primary School now hosts the London Fields Farmers' Market and there is a crafts market adjacent to the building next door.</p>\\n<p>A document in Hackney library records a game of cricket to have been played on the park as early as 1802, and the cricket square on London Fields continues to host competitive games throughout the summer (late April\\u00a0\\u2014 mid September). Several teams from the North East London Cricket League regard the park as their home pitch, most notably London Fields CC, based from the Pub on the Park. During the summer the park can be extremely busy with many people combining an afternoon's picnic with watching the cricket. The Turley End of the ground is a popular vantage point for those watching the cricket.</p>\\n<p>The area has been connected with some notable instances of gun crime in recent years.

It is bordered to the west by Hackney Central, to the north by Lower Clapton, in the east by Hackney Wick, Leyton and by South Hackney to the south.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Origins</h3>\\n<p>Archaeological excavations at Link Street exposed a building dating to the 11th or 12th century suggesting that Homerton existed before it was first recorded in 1343. The hamlet of Homerton (Humberton or Hummerton, named for the farm of a woman named Hunburh) developed for about a half-mile along the road on the north side of the now buried and lost Hackney Brook, within the vale formed by the brook. This led from the hamlet of Clopton, passing near the church of St Augustine at Hackney, then across the marshes and the crossing points of both the River Lea, and its tributary, Hackney Brook. By 1605 Homerton was the most populous part of the Parish of Hackney, becoming a separate parish in 1846.</p>\\n<h3>Medieval Homerton</h3>\\n<p>In medieval times, Homerton, like much of Hackney, was predominantly rural and arable crops were grown, together with fruit and vegetables for the City of London markets. The majority of land was given over to pasture for sheep and cattle, and milk and cheese was also supplied to the City. Small kitchen gardens ran at the back of the houses along the road, with large fields behind. Domestic brewing was common (there are records of brewing performed at Sutton House and the Tan House). Many unsavoury activities (banned in the City) were also undertaken, such as tanning and fulling - the cleaning of felt cloth using urine.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor wealth</h3>\\n\\n<p>Homerton became a desirable suburb of London in the Tudor period, with many estates and grand houses being formed from the former Templar lands (Knights Templar of St. John of Jerusalem). The village was divided between Upper and Lower Homerton, with the later extending towards the marshes and the house at Hackney Wick. Upper Homerton was divided from the village of Hackney by the width of the rectory manor's Church Field, and a path led to the churchyard. In 1538, this estate, including other fields lying along the brook, passed to the Tudor diplomat Sir Ralph Sadler. Around 1560 part of this estate came into the ownership of Thomas Sutton, a resident of the Tan House (adjacent to Sutton House). This land formed part of his endowment of the Hospital of King James in Charterhouse, who continued to own the property until the 20th century, building Sutton Place between 1790 and 1806.</p>\\n<h3>The marshes</h3>\\n\\n<p>Marsh Road, from Homerton High Street, led to, and across the marshes, towards the Templar owned water powered corn mill at Temple Mills. Prone to flooding, the marshes were primarily used for grazing. A Roman stone causeway was discovered in the 1770s.</p>\\n<p>By 1795 the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead. Sheets of lead were placed in clay pots and submerged in urine, then heated by decaying cow dung. The process converted the lead to lead oxide, and it was then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint. A new watermill was established on the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.</p>\\n<h3>Religion and education</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the 18th century the availability of land, large houses and tolerance to dissenters made Homerton a popular place to found institutions. The educational ones were commonly known as Dissenting Academies. The Kings Head Society moved to a large house here in 1768, forming Homerton College for the education of Calvinist ministers with between 12-20 students. Religious education moved to the new University College London in 1826, but Homerton College remained here as a teacher training college until 1896, when it moved to Cambridge, eventually becoming a full college of the University of Cambridge offering nearly all subjects from 2002. Students from Homerton college were principal in forming, in 1881, both the Glynn Cricket Club and Clapton Orient - which became Leyton Orient F.C. on its move to Leyton. The buildings of the College were rebuilt and expanded several times, but eventually lost to bomb damage in World War II.</p>\\n\\n<p>South of the Brook, by Money Lane, the Unitarian Gravel Pit Meeting House was built between 1715-16. This was the result of an acrimonious split in the congregation of the Lower Clapton meeting. Notable nonconformist ministers preached at the Old Gravel Pit. The moral and political philosopher Richard Price, known for his support of the American Revolution, became morning preacher in 1770, while continuing his afternoon sermons at Newington Green Chapel, on the green where he lived. Those who attended his sermons in Homerton included American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon at Old Jewry meeting house entitled \\\"A Discourse on the Love of our Country\\\", thus igniting a so-called \\\"pamphlet war\\\" known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal \\\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\\" attacked Price, whose friends Thomas Paine and Mary Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to his sermons, which were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated). Another eminent minister was the formidable polymath, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When his support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for London; he was appointed minister here in 1793. Today a Blue Plaque marks the site of the Gravel Pit Meeting House in Ram Place and a brown plaque marks the site of the Priestley's house at 113 Lower Clapton Road (on the corner of Clapton Passage). Priestley said of his time here, \\\"On the whole I spent my life more happily at Hackney than I had ever done before\\\". The meeting house is now used as a factory.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian era</h3>\\n<p>A spur connecting the North London Railway at Dalston to Stratford, forming a part of the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, opened in 1847 for the carriage of coal. This resulted in Hackney Brook being placed in a culvert and the loss of the extensive watercress fields to the south of Homerton High Street. Its later development as a passenger line led to the redevelopment in the 1880s of the medieval core of the village on Homerton High Street with Victorian dwellings and public houses, and speculative building on the lands either side of Homerton High Street. In 1868 Homerton Station opened.</p>\\n<p>By the 1860s, London fell prey to epidemics of fever. The 200 bed Eastern Fever Hospital was founded in September 1870 by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to prevent contagion. There were six wards for typhus, two each for scarlet fever and enteric patients. Two smaller wards were reserved for 'special cases'. The buildings were demolished in 1982 and the site became the core of the modern Homerton University Hospital. This replaced the old Hackney Hospital which (in turn) had been formed from the Hackney Union Workhouse. These buildings are now used by the Hackney Mental Health Trust.</p>\\n<h3>Industry and housing</h3>\\n<p>The coming of the railways and the building of the fever hospital drove many of the wealthier residents away. The tightly packed Victorian streets provided homes for the clerks and employees of the new purpose built factories (like Berger Paints) being built in the area. From 1937 onwards, the London County Council built mass housing, sweeping away the worst of the slums, but also eliminating many older buildings containing shops on Homerton High Street, effectively destroying it as a commercial area. The Lesney die cast model factory was built in the 1940s on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation, just north of Homerton Road, producing for many years their <i>Matchbox</i> brand. The factory closed in 1990, and was demolished in 2010.</p>\\n<p>The oldest surviving residential building in Hackney is Sutton House on Homerton High Street. It was built in 1535 and is owned and run by the National Trust.</p>\\n<h3>In modern times</h3>\\n\\n<p>1970s glam rock singer Marc Bolan and actor Ray Winstone were born in Hackney Hospital, on Homerton High Street. The hospital, originally built in 1841 as the Hackney Union workhouse, finally closed in 1995, its poor reputation contrasting with that of the new Homerton University Hospital which opened in 1987 on a site nearby. The old hospital has now been refurbished (2006) and reopened to serve the mental health trust.</p>\\n<p>Homerton's links with popular music continued with the arrival of Toerag, an eight track recording studio which uses reclaimed 1960s analogue equipment, where notably the White Stripes' acclaimed 2003 album <i>Elephant</i> was produced. Babyshambles frontman and ex-Libertine, Pete Doherty has reputedly given his address as Homerton  but it has been confirmed that he is receiving treatment as an outpatient at Homerton University Hospital for addiction.</p>\\n\\n<p>Homerton is also home to Chats Palace arts centre, named after the nearby Chatsworth Road. Chats Palace has presented and encouraged a wide variety of music, comedy, theatre, photography, carnival, disability arts, dance and transgressive performance, including Clifford Jarvis, Tom Hunter, Miniscule of Sound, Red Saunders, Asian Dub Foundation and Graeae Theatre Company. It also hosts an array of classes for all abilities and age ranges, and has been an accessible and affordable space for local people to celebrate their important occasions or present their projects. The building itself was originally established as a Carnegie library for the betterment of the people of the East End. The council closed the library in 1977 but the building was reclaimed by members of the local community.</p>\\n<p>Although this has been, in recent years, a rather depressed area of Hackney, itself a poor borough, Homerton's prospects are brightening. The arrival of the Channel Link at nearby Stratford, coupled with the London Summer Olympics, which took place nearby in 2012, may spell a revival in its fortunes.</p>\\n<p>Homerton is served by Homerton University Hospital, an NHS foundation trust hospital.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Secondary schools located in the area include Cardinal Pole RC School and the City Academy, Hackney.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>The nearest London Overground stations are <i>Hackney Central</i> and <i>Homerton</i></p>\\n<h2>References and notes</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Tudor Hackney (from the National Archives)</li>\\n<li>Hackney 1795 (<i>Hackney</i>, The Environs of London: volume 2: County of Middlesex)</li>\\n<li>Jacobs, Catherine <i>I Want to Go Home</i> (Book Guild Ltd) ISBN 1-85776-925-2 - Growing up in Homerton, a family memoir</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Chats Palace Arts Centre</li>\\n<li>Homerton University Hospital</li>\\n<li>Sutton House information at the National Trust</li>\\n<li>Toerag Studios</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1004.1,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":42268409,\"title\":\"Rose Hudson-Wilkin\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Rose Josephine Hudson-Wilkin</b> (born 19 January 1961) is an Anglican vicar in Hackney who also holds the roles of Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons, priest vicar at Westminster Abbey and chaplain to the Queen.

While immensely well connected to Central London, including the City of London, the seat generally has moderate incomes rather than high, and a narrow majority of wards had a relatively high ranking when placed in the Index of Multiple Deprivation, compiled in 2000. In line with most of Greater London since 2000 many parts, especially Stamford Hill, Upper Clapton, Lower Clapton have become marginal in terms of local councillors and these districts, with to a lesser extent the eponymous Hackney and Stoke Newington, are in the process of becoming re-gentrified with ongoing increases in land value, proximity to the London 2012 venues and a council that successfully reduced the level of crime by about 30 per cent within a four year period. Demographically, almost 60 per cent of households are singletons and households have a higher than average level of unemployment. Through all this change, under incumbent Diane Abbott, the seat has become a safe seat for Labour. Abbott is the politician who for many years preceded Alan Milburn as Labour's latest events commentator opposite Michael Portillo on the current light-hearted political round-up of events series <i>This Week</i>.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The seat was created in 1950 and has gone through many changes: in January 2006 the boundary moved again, this time to correspond with the local government ward boundaries.</p>\\n<p>Following major electoral reform at the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, part of the Third Reform Act, the seat of Hackney was divided into two and Hackney North was formed, this time to return only one Member of Parliament, commencing with the 1885 general election.</p>\\n<p>The Stoke Newington constituency was created at the 1918 general election by the division of the Hackney North constituency by the Representation of the People Act, 1918, known generally as Fourth Reform Act; an Act most importantly remembered for the first time extending suffrage to women. The constituency was identical in area to the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington.</p>\\n<p>Following a decrease in the population the two constituencies were merged by the Representation of the People Act, 1948, retaining David Weitzman as MP and becoming the current constituency in the 1950 general election.</p>\\n<h2>Boundaries</h2>\\n<p><b>1950-1955</b>: The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney wards of Leaside, Maury, Southwold, Springfield and Stamford.</p>\\n<p><b>1955-1974</b>: The Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney wards of Northfield, Northwold, Rectory and Springfield.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>The constituency covers the northern part of the London Borough of Hackney.

Its borders are Kingsland Road in the east, Southgate Road to the west, the Regent's Canal in the south and Ball's Pond Road to the north.</p>\\n<p>It shares the northern London postal district of N1 with neighbouring Islington, Barnsbury, Canonbury and Hoxton.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>Until 1820 the area now covered by De Beauvoir Town was open country with a few grand houses. In 1821, stimulated by the opening of the Regent's Canal the previous year, developer and brick maker William Rhodes (1774-1843), a grandfather of Cecil Rhodes, secured a lease for 150 acres (0.61\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of land from Peter de Beauvoir. Rhodes planned to build residences for the upper classes in a grid pattern, with four squares on diagonal streets intersecting at an octagon. However, work stopped in 1823 when Rhodes was found to have obtained his lease unfairly and after a court case spanning over 20 years the land reverted to the de Beauvoir family in 1834.</p>\\n<p>The delay in building had meant that Rhodes' clientele had since moved on to the new suburbs of the West End. The scheme was scaled down and of the planned squares only the southeastern was built, as De Beauvoir Square, although the diagonals partly survived in Enfield Road, Stamford Road and Ardleigh Road. Occupied in the 1840s by the newly emerging middle classes, the estate was almost wholly residential except around Kingsland Basin and the south-west corner where a factory was leased from 1823.</p>\\n<h3>20th Century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In 1937, due to its easy access to Kingsland Basin, the southeast corner between Downham Road and Hertford Road was re-zoned for industrial use. Soon after all the area south of Downham Road was included. This distinguished it from the north side of Downham Road, which was already zoned for business and acted as a buffer for the mainly residential streets beyond. In 1938 De Beauvoir Crescent was suggested as another business zone to protect housing to the north.</p>\\n<p>In the early 1960s the northern part of De Beauvoir Town between Buckingham Road and Tottenham Road was rebuilt as the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney's Kingsgate estate. In the late 1960s a larger area west of the canal basin, which contained many small factories, made way for the De Beauvoir Estate. The east side of De Beauvoir Square was also rebuilt as the Lockner Road estate.</p>\\n<p>In 1968 the De Beauvoir Town association was formed. The rest of the square with the area bounded by Englefield Road, Northchurch Road, Southgate Road, Hertford Road, and Stamford Road became a conservation area in 1969. This area was later extended to cover most of De Beauvoir Town; the eastern edge, however, is in the Kingsland conservation area.</p>\\n<h2>Notable residents</h2>\\n<p>Edmund Gosse, the poet, the son of naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, lived in the area.</p>\\n<p>De Beauvoir Town was home to William Lyttle (1931\\u20132010), a retired electrical engineer known as the <i>Mole Man of Hackney</i>, who dug a series of tunnels under his 20-room property on the corner of Mortimer Road and Stamford Road. In 2001, his tunnelling caused an 8\\u00a0ft (2.4\\u00a0m) hole to appear in the pavement on Stamford Road. Reports that the tunnelling had started again in 2006 were confirmed when Hackney Council found a network of tunnels and caverns, some 8\\u00a0m (26\\u00a0ft) deep, spreading up to 20m in every direction from his house.</p>\\n<p>In August 2006, the council obtained a court order banning Lyttle from his property.

ground and greyhound stadium in the Lower Clapton area of London. It was the home ground of Clapton Orient between 1896 and 1930.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>The stadium was originally named <b>Whittles Athletic Ground</b> and was mostly used for whippet racing. In 1896 Clapton Orient moved to the site from Pond Land Bridge, after which it became known as <b>Millfields Road</b>. The football club began redeveloping the stadium, with large embankments were built around the pitch using slag from an adjacent power station.</p>\\n<p>Clapton Orient were elected to the Second Division of the Football League in 1905, and the first Football League was played at the ground on 9 September 1905, with Clapton beating Hull City 1\\u20130 in front of 3,000 spectators. In 1906 the first covered spectator facility was provided, when a 2,000-seat grandstand was built. This stand was sold to Wimbledon to use at their Plough Lane ground in 1923, and was replaced by a 3,000-seat stand.</p>\\n<p>In 1927 the Clapton Stadium Syndicate became joint tenants, and major alterations were made to the ground to allow for greyhound racing, costing over \\u00a380,000. An oval track was installed around the football pitch, with covered concrete terracing laid on the three sides away from the main stand. The new layout was designed by Owen Williams, and the ground became London's fourth greyhound track, staging its first meeting on 7 April 1928. In 1928 the track hosted a new race over 400 yards that gained classic status called the Scurry Gold Cup.</p>\\n<p>Clapton set their record League attendance at the ground on 16 March 1929 when 37,615 saw them lose 3\\u20132 to Tottenham Hotspur. However, the club were in financial trouble at the end of the 1920s and were forced to leave the ground, moving to the Lea Bridge Stadium. Their last match at the ground was a 4\\u20131 win over Brighton on 3 May 1930 with 8,763 in attendance.</p>\\n<p>In 1939 the greyhound track underwent improvements and a second restaurant was built.</p>\\n<p>In 1966 the Clapton shareholders contemplated a bid from the GRA which included two training sites with 180 acres and an interest in West Ham Stadium. The deal went ahead in 1967. In 1969 the track was then sold by GRA and the track's demise caused much upset. It eventually closed for the final time on 1 January 1974.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":1615.3,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":19423206,\"title\":\"Peter McDonald (artist)\",\"text\":\"<p>He is represented in the UK by Kate MacGarry and in Japan by Gallery Side 2.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q7175768\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":10982568,\"title\":\"Dr Lakra\",\"text\":\"<p>Dr Lakra is represented by kurimanzutto, Mexico City and Kate MacGarry, London.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Dr_Lakra_in_Los_Angeles.jpg\",\"wikidata\":\"Q4153348\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":13231444,\"title\":\"Goshka Macuga\",\"text\":\"<p>Goshka Macuga is represented by Kate MacGarry (London), R&#252;diger Sch&#246;ttle (Munich) and Andrew Kreps Gallery (New York).</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q5587310\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1}],\"type\":\"landmark\",\"image\":\"\",\"title\":\"Kate MacGarry\",\"lon\":-0.0564,\"wikidata\":\"Q6375617\",\"lat\":51.5345,\"pageid\":18074797,\"ns\":0,\"extract\":\"<p><b>Kate MacGarry</b> is a contemporary art gallery located in London.

All of its publications are designed by \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n<p>Dent-de-Leone were inspired by Factory Records early contracts, so that each artist retains the ownership of their back catalogue. They sell direct to individuals and bookshops bypassing the usual model of selling in bulk to book distributors who often take a large percentage of the cover price. Doing this allows Dent-de-Leone to offer a low retail price for their work, and pay a large proportion to the published artist. All profits are directed into making new books. Dent-de-Leone began as a vanity publishing project, but quickly expanded as other artists and designers contacted the publishers attracted by the avant-garde design and the distribution model. The books are intended to disseminate the ideas and aesthetics of the published artists, designers and writers. The free Typeface WAR is available on the website of Dent-de-Leone. WAR is a typeface which deconstructs all the \\\"official\\\" countries' flags (2006) to allow a random redesign of your own country.</p>\\n<h2>Origin of the name</h2>\\n<p>The name Dent-De-Leone is derived from the dandelion, a common plant often cooked during the <i>Social Pasta</i> events created by Martino Gamper and \\u00c5b\\u00e4ke.

It is 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Boundaries</h2>\\n<p>In modern terms, <b>Stoke Newington</b> (informally called <b>Stokey</b> by the local residents ) can be roughly defined by the N16 postcode area (though this also includes parts of Stamford Hill and the almost forgotten district of Shacklewell). Its southern boundary with Dalston is quite ill-defined too, but it was once a well-defined administrative unit. In 1899 the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington was formed out of the greater part of the parish of that name. The resulting boundaries seem rather anomalous now; the entire eastern side of Stoke Newington High Street and beyond, including Stoke Newington Common, were included in the next door Metropolitan Borough of Hackney, but in fact this area was then part of the parish of Hackney \\u2013 not Stoke Newington \\u2013 and much of it would have been regarded as being in Shacklewell at the time. These apparent oddities became moot when in 1965, the Metropolitan Borough became part of the London Borough of Hackney. Immediately to the south of Stoke Newington is Newington Green, also ill-defined, though originally they were two distinct villages separated by a mile of fields.</p>\\n<p>Throughout all these changes, the core of Stoke Newington, centred around Church Street, has retained its own distinct 'London village' character; indeed, Nikolaus Pevsner confessed that he found it hard to see the district as being in London at all.</p>\\n<h2>Open space</h2>\\n\\n<p>For one small district, Stoke Newington is endowed with a generous amount of open space. To its north, there is the extensive West Reservoir, now a non-working facility, but open for leisure and surrounded by greenspace, at the entrance to which is the architecturally bizarre Castle Climbing Centre, once the main Water Board pumping station. It was originally designed, by William Chadwell Mylne, to look like a towering Scottish castle, and is now much-loved in the area.</p>\\n<p>South of these facilities is Clissold Park, an extensive swathe of parkland complete with a small menagerie, aviary and Clissold Mansion, a Grade II listed building, built for Jonathan Hoare, a local Quaker and brother of Samuel Hoare, in the 1790s.</p>\\n<p>Tracking east from here and past the two Church of England parish churches, both called St Mary's [1] (Stoke Newington strangely decided to retain the old one, unusual in a London parish), leads to Abney Park Cemetery, one of the most splendid and enlightened of Victorian London cemeteries. It is now a nature reserve, a role that it was in many ways originally intended for, as it was set up as an arboretum, but Abney Park became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain's historic park and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Finally, across the high street to the east is the fragmented Stoke Newington Common. This, however, has its charms, largely due to the extensive and diverse programme of tree planting it has enjoyed in recent years.</p>\\n<h2>Reservoirs</h2>\\n<p>From the 16th century onwards, Stoke Newington has played a prominent role in assuring a water supply to sustain London's rapid growth. Hugh Myddleton's New River runs through the area and still makes a contribution to London's water. Although this originally terminated at the New River Head in Finsbury, since 1946 its main flow has ended at Stoke Newington reservoirs, though a slow ornamental trickle flows past the West Reservoir to go underground for a stretch on Green Lanes, reappearing for a time in Clissold Park only to disappear underground again on its way to Canonbury. The river bank, the New River Path, can be walked for some distance to the north through Haringey and on to its source near Hertford, though not all sections are open.</p>\\n\\n<p>Stoke Newington East and West Reservoirs, to the north of Clissold Park, are quite substantial for urban facilities. Stoke Newington Reservoirs were constructed in 1833 to purify the New River water and to act as a water reserve. As mentioned, the West Reservoir is now a leisure facility, offering sailing, canoeing and other water sports, plus Royal Yachting Association- approved sailing courses. On its western edge stands the former filter house, now set out as a visitor centre with a caf\\u00e9; some of the old hydraulic machinery can be viewed in the main hall. The pumping station at the reservoir gates, converted to a climbing centre in 1995 (as mentioned above) was designed in a distinctive castellated style by Robert Billings under the supervision of William Chadwell Mylne and built in 1854\\u201356.</p>\\n<p>Besides the water board facilities and the New River, Clissold Park also contains two large ornamental lakes, a home to many water birds and a population of terrapins. These lakes \\u2013 purportedly the remains of clay pits dug for the bricks used in the building of Clissold House \\u2013 are all that is left to mark the course of the Hackney Brook, one of London's lost rivers, which once flowed from west to east across Stoke Newington on its way to the River Lea. In flood at this point, the brook was known to span 10 metres. The two lakes are not actually fed from the brook, which has long disappeared into the maze of sewers under London, but from the mains supply \\u2013 ultimately the New River.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Early</h3>\\n\\n<p>Stoke Newington or 'new town in the wood', has been lightly settled for many hundreds of years, close to larger neighbouring Saxon settlements near the River Lea. In the 19th century it was discovered that Stoke Newington Common and Abney Park Cemetery had been part of a Neolithic working area for axe-making, some examples of which can be seen in the Museum of London.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington is recorded as part of the Ossulstone hundred in the county of Middlesex in the Domesday Book of 1086. In the 17th century, for administrative purposes the west of Stoke Newington High Street became part of the new Finsbury division and the east part of the Tower division. Both divisions were in 1889 then incorporated into the County of London.</p>\\n<p>In the Middle Ages and Tudor times, it was a very small village a few miles from the city of London, frequently visited by wayfarers as a pit stop before journeying north, Stoke Newington High Street being part of the Cambridge road (A10). At this date the whole manor was owned by St. Paul's Cathedral and yielded a small income, enough to support part of their work. During the 17th century the Cathedral sold the Manor to William Patten, who became the first Lord of the Manor. His initials 'WP' and the motto 'ab alto' can be seen inscribed above the doorway of the old church next to Clissold Park.</p>\\n<h3>18th century</h3>\\n<p>A century later, it passed to Lady Mary Abney who drew up the first detailed maps of field boundaries and began to lay out a manorial parkland behind today's fire station on Church Street, with the aid of her daughters and Dr Isaac Watts.</p>\\n<h3>19th century</h3>\\n<p>During the early 19th century, as London expanded, the Manor of Stoke Newington was 'enfranchised' to be sold in parcels as freehold land for building purposes. Gradually the village became absorbed into the seamless expansion of London. It was no longer a separate village by the mid-to-late 19th century.</p>\\n<p>Being on the outskirts at this time, many expensive and large houses were built to house London's expanding population of <i>nouveau riche</i> whose journey to the commercial heart of the capital was made possible by the birth of the railways and the first omnibuses. The latter were first introduced into central London in the 1820s by George Shillibeer, following his successful trial of the world's first school bus for William Allen and Susannah Corder's novel Quaker school, Newington Academy for Girls. By the mid-nineteenth century, Stoke Newington had \\\"the largest concentration of Quakers in London\\\", including many who had moved up the A10 from Gracechurch Street meeting house in the City. A meeting house was built in Park Street (now Yoakley Road) by the architect William Alderson, who later designed Hanwell Lunatic Asylum.</p>\\n<p>St Mary's Lodge on Lordship Road, the 1843 home of architect and district surveyor John Young, is the last-surviving of several grand detached houses built in the area around that time for well-off members of the new commuter class. Gibson Gardens, an early example of quality tenement buildings erected for the housing of 'the industrious classes', were built off Stoke Newington High Street in 1880 and still stand today.</p>\\n<p>As a late Victorian and Edwardian suburb, Stoke Newington prospered, and continued in relative affluence and civic pride with its own municipal government until changes brought about by the Second World War.</p>\\n<h3>Early 20th century</h3>\\n<p>Between 1935\\u201337, the curved brick and Portland Stone Town Hall was built for the Metropolitan Borough of Stoke Newington by J. Reginald Truelove.</p>\\n<h3>Second World War</h3>\\n\\n<p>During World War II, much of the area was damaged in the Blitz and many were made homeless, although the level of destruction was much lower than in those areas of East London further south such as Stepney or Shoreditch or even in next-door Hackney. The death toll was also relatively low: almost three-quarters of civilian deaths being due to one tragic incident on 13 October 1940 when a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue off the high street received a direct hit. The memorial to all the residents of the Borough who died in the air raids, including local Jewish people, can be seen in Abney Park Cemetery. Like Hackney and Tottenham, Stoke Newington avoided most of the later V-weapon attacks, which fell disproportionately on South London; only a total of seven V-1s and two V-2s hit the borough.</p>\\n<p>Most of the historic buildings at the heart of Stoke Newington survived, at least in a repairable state. Two notable exceptions are the classically grand parish church of West Hackney, St James's, on Stoke Newington Road, which dated from 1824, and St Faith's, a Victorian Gothic church by William Burges. Both were so severely damaged, the former in the October 1940 bombing, and the latter by a flying bomb in 1944, that they were entirely demolished. St James's was replaced after the war by a much more modest structure, St Paul's, which is set well back from the street. Traces of the old church's stonework can still be seen facing Stoke Newington Road.</p>\\n<h3>Postwar developments</h3>\\n<p>After the war a substantial amount of residential housing, particularly to the east of modern Stoke Newington, in Hackney borough at the time, had been either destroyed or left in such a bad state that it was seen by the urban planners of that era as better to demolish it. Postwar redevelopment has replaced many of these areas with large estates, some more successful than others. Much of this residential redevelopment was planned by Frederick Gibberd, the designer of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.</p>\\n<h4>Political radicalism and terrorism</h4>\\n<p>Ever a home to radicals, Communist Party meetings were held in the Town Hall in the post-war years. And although Stoke Newington became part of the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, it has never quite lost its own identity. Indeed, following the 1960s, it increasingly became home to a number of squatters, artists, bohemians and also political radicals. Famously, the 'Stoke Newington 8' were arrested on 20 August 1971 at 359 Amhurst Road for suspected involvement in The Angry Brigade bombings.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most famous examples of political terrorism by Stoke Newington residents, none originally from the area, are Patrick Hayes, Jan Taylor and Muktar Said Ibrahim. The first two were convicted of two bombings and had substantial links to the huge lorry bombs of the 1990s. Both were arrested, firing at officers in Walford Road and later sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.</p>\\n<p>The third, Muktar Said Ibrahim, was convicted, as the ring leader, on an indictment of conspiracy to murder. He planted a failed bomb on a 26 bus, which misfired later on the Hackney Road on 21 July 2005. Ibrahim used to work at an off-licence on Amhurst Road. In February 2005, police were seeking Ibrahim on an arrest warrant for an outstanding public order offence and sent a letter to his Farleigh Road address saying \\\"Call us, before we call you.\\\" After the attack, Ibrahim was seen on the run in Farleigh Road and was later arrested in Dalgrano Gardens, W10. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of forty years before being considered for release.</p>\\n<h3>21st century</h3>\\n<p>These days, Stoke Newington is a very multicultural area, with large Asian, Irish, Turkish, Jewish and Afro-Caribbean communities. The area continues to be home to many new and emerging communities such as Polish and Somali immigrants.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington has undergone major gentrification, as have neighbouring Newington Green, Canonbury and Dalston. Much of the gentrification of the area has been based around Church Street, where there are many independent shops, pubs, bars and cafes.</p>\\n<p>On Saturday mornings, St Paul's churchyard in Stoke Newington High Street hosts an active farmers' market \\u2013 relocated in July/August 2011 from its earlier site in the playground of William Patten Primary school on Church Street. This was the first farmers' market in the UK to have only organic and biodynamic producers.</p>\\n<p>In June 2011 property developer Newmark Properties LLP announced their proposed development for Wilmer Place. This includes a large Sainsburys supermarket, \\\"high quality private and affordable residential apartments\\\" and a 90+ vehicle car park. This development requires the demolition of some of the existing properties in Wilmer Place and 195\\u2013201 Stoke Newington High Street.

It has had strong ties to political radicalism for over 300 years, and is London's oldest Nonconformist place of worship still in use. It was founded in 1708 by English Dissenters, a community of which had been gathering around Newington Green for at least half a century before that date. The church belongs to the umbrella organisation known as the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, and has had an upturn in its fortunes since the turn of the millennium.</p>\\n<p>Its most famous minister was Dr Richard Price, a political radical who is remembered for his role in the Revolution Controversy, a British debate about the French Revolution, but who also did pioneering work in finance and statistics. The most famous member of its congregation was Mary Wollstonecraft, who drew inspiration from Price's sermons in her work, both in arguing for the new French republic and in raising the issue of the rights of women.</p>\\n<p>The building, which faces the north side of the green, was extended in 1860, and was listed in 1953. It lies within the London Borough of Hackney, although the rest of the green is part of the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Background to its creation</h2>\\n<p>After the end of Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth and the Restoration of Charles II, those in England and Wales who were not members of the Church of England found themselves in an uncomfortable position. Several pieces of legislation, known collectively as the Clarendon Code, made their lives difficult. The first restricted public office to Anglicans. The Act of Uniformity the following year was a step too far for many clergymen, and about 2,000 of them left the established church in the Great Ejection of 1662. The third act forbad unauthorised religious meetings of more than five people. The final one prohibited Nonconformist clergymen from living within five miles of a parish from which they had been banned. Where the ministers went, their flocks tended to follow. Some of these restrictions were ameliorated a generation later, with the passing of the Act of Toleration 1689, which guaranteed freedom of worship for certain groups. It allowed Nonconformists (or Dissenters) their own places of worship and their own teachers and preachers, subject to certain oaths of allegiance and to the registering of these locations and leaders, but it perpetuated their existing social and political disabilities, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities (Oxford and Cambridge were the only universities in England and Wales at that time).</p>\\n<p>Roman Catholics were specifically targeted by these acts, and many of them went underground. Some Christians who had hoped for a more Protestant Reformation within the Established Church chose to emigrate, especially to the American colonies, as the Pilgrim Fathers had done in 1620. Others maintained their faith openly, and lived with the restrictions the state placed upon them, moving to areas where they were tolerated. Often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such was at Newington Green, then an agricultural village a few miles from London, but now within Inner London. Unitarianism or Rational Dissent\\u00a0\\u2013 \\\"that intellectual aristocracy in the ranks of Dissent, as historians often characterise it\\\"\\u00a0\\u2013 had an obvious affinity with education, critical enquiry, and challenges to the <i>status quo</i>, and is \\\"one of the roots of modern English Culture\\\". A critical mass of such people, including \\\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\\" and \\\"the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\\" clustered around Newington Green. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians, such as Quaker John Coakley Lettsome (physician, philanthropist, and abolitionist) or the Anglicans Vicesimus Knox (pacifist and writer) and George Gaskin (minister and long-time secretary of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge), but most had some connections to the chapel on the green.</p>\\n<h2>The building and its religious neighbours</h2>\\n\\n<p>The original 1708 building was financed with \\u00a3300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison, equivalent to about \\u00a342,100 as of 2014. He leased it to the trustees of the congregation, who furnished it with pulpit, pews, and so on, raising the necessary \\u00a396 from about 20\\u00a0subscribers, primarily by hiring or selling pews. It was a \\\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\\", \\\"Historic views show that the original fa\\u00e7ade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\\" It was too plain for Wollstonecraft's Anglican tastes, and one of her biographers thought it defiantly stark. This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-nineteenth century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a \\\"stuccoed frontage\\\" was built, \\\"mirroring the original fa\\u00e7ade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\\". In the mid-twentieth century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Other religious institutions existed nearby. St Matthias, one of London's foremost High Churches, was built a couple of hundred yards away between 1849 and 1853, partly with money from a rich doctor named Robert Brett, who thought that the Dissenting chapels were attracting so many worshippers in part because the Anglican pews were full. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation in the area by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This Victorian Gothic building became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936. Fronting onto the green itself was the China Inland Mission headquarters (circa 1895), an organisation responsible for 18,000\\u00a0converts to Christianity that had been founded by James Hudson Taylor at the height of the Victorian era. St Matthias still operates as a church; the synagogue was demolished in the 1970s; the missionary building is now international student housing.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green fell within the old parish boundaries of Stoke Newington. Although the latter village, centred on Church Street, was a mile away from the hamlet of the Green, across farmland or along the ancient drovers' road of Green Lanes, the two places had and still have a close connection. From the mid-1640s to the mid-1650s, Stoke Newington's parish church was led by Thomas Manton, \\\"a principal person among the non-conformist ministers\\\",; a staunch and popular defender of Reformed principles, he participated in the Westminster Assembly, acted as chaplain to Oliver Cromwell, and preached before Parliament on several occasions. Another Dissenting meeting house was built in Stoke Newington about 1700, near the house of Mary Abney, who had inherited the manor. Later that century the village became known for its Quaker inhabitants; their meeting house was designed by the architect William Alderson. In 1858 the medieval parish church of St Mary was supplemented by an impressive Victorian Gothic building opposite, by Sir George Gilbert Scott. In addition to the buildings, Stoke Newington was remarkable for its range of social reforms, from its connections to the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade to the foundation of the innovative Newington Academy for Girls.</p>\\n<p>As the NGUC lacks its own cemetery, some of its congregants, such as the poet and banker Samuel Rogers, are buried in St Mary's churchyard. However, as the Church of England normally limits its cemeteries to its members, most of the Newington Green Unitarians opted for Bunhill Fields until the middle of the nineteenth century, and then Abney Park Cemetery thereafter. (Robert Southey called the former the Campo Santo of the Dissenters, but the phrase was used for both.) Wollstonecraft was married and later buried at St Pancras Old Church a few miles away.</p>\\n<h2>Earliest years: to the mid-eighteenth century</h2>\\n<p>Newington Green Unitarian Church has been associated with many historically significant people on both sides of the pulpit, especially but not exclusively in the eighteenth century. Charles Morton (1626\\u20131698), the great educator who ended his career as vice-president of Harvard University, ran an influential Dissenting Academy, \\\"probably on the site of the current Unitarian church\\\". One of his friends, James Ashurst, founded a group that worshipped in private houses licensed for the purpose, and, in time, this small congregation decided to build a proper meeting house. (It is worth mentioning here the early religious evolution of this church. It started as Presbyterian, with views on the Trinity as orthodox as those held by the Church of England. In fact, several of its first ministers chose to conform, i.e. rejoin, the established church: one of these was Richard Biscoe, who gave the Boyle Lectures in the late 1730s. However, NGUC soon acquired ministers who were Arian, that is, who denied the Trinity, although they retained their belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Thus was the Unitarian nature of the church created. In the mid-nineteenth century it was described by a local historian as a Socinian Independent meeting house.) The author Daniel Defoe, who attended school at Newington Green, is believed to have attended the church. Isaac Watts, the \\\"Father of English Hymnody\\\", theologian, logician, and educator, was brought up as a non-Conformist, lived from 1736-1748 at Abney Park nearby, and during that period \\\"was known to have adopted decidedly Unitarian opinions\\\", so he too may have attended NGUC. Samuel Wright, son of a nonconformist minister in Nottinghamshire, writer on theological issues and \\\"a very eminent divine among the Presbyterians\\\" lived at Newington Green until his death in 1746. Several of the church's ministers were at the same time, or had been, the librarians at the theological collection known as Dr Williams's Library, an establishment still very much alive.</p>\\n<h2>Later eighteenth century: the voices heard round the world</h2>\\n<h3>Richard Price</h3>\\n\\n<p>The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's \\\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\\". He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old. (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658.) In that house, or the church itself, he was visited by Founding Fathers of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine; other American politicians such as John Adams, who later became the second president of the United States, and his wife Abigail; British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as \\\"Citizen Stanhope\\\"), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke, and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb, who between them campaigned on expansion of the franchise, opposition to the war with America, support for the French Revolution, abolitionism, and an end to legal discrimination against Roman Catholics; writers such as poet and banker Samuel Rogers; and clergyman-mathematician Thomas Bayes, known for Bayes' theorem.</p>\\n<p>Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of the above, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. More than once, Price and the elder Rogers rode on horseback to Wales. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. When in 1770 Price became morning preacher at the Gravel Pit Chapel in Homerton, he continued his afternoon sermons at NGUC.</p>\\n\\n<p>And there were many at a distance who acknowledged their debt to Price, such as the Unitarian theologians William Ellery Channing and Theophilus Lindsey, and the formidable polymath and Dissenting clergyman, Joseph Priestley, discoverer of oxygen. When Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.</p>\\n<p>The support Price gave to the revolt of the colonies of British North America, arguing that the American Revolution was justified, made his name as a famous or notorious preacher. He rejected traditional Christian notions of original sin and moral punishment, preaching the perfectibility of human nature, and he wrote on theological questions. However, his interests were wide-ranging, and during the decades Price spent as minister of NGUC, he also wrote on finance, economics, probability, and life insurance, being inducted into the Royal Society in recognition of his work. On the 101st anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, he preached a sermon titled \\\"A Discourse on the Love of our Country\\\", thus igniting a so-called \\\"pamphlet war\\\" known as the Revolution Controversy, furiously debating the issues raised by the French Revolution. Burke's rebuttal \\\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\\" attacked Price, whose friends Paine and Wollstonecraft leapt into the fray to defend their mentor. The reputation of Price for speaking without fear of the government on these political and philosophical matters drew huge crowds to the church, and were published and sold as pamphlets (i.e. publications easily printed and circulated).</p>\\n<h3>Mary Wollstonecraft</h3>\\n\\n<p>Arguably the congregant Price most influenced was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to the Green in 1784, with the help of a \\\"fairy godmother\\\" whose good auspices found her a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. Her patron \\u2014 or matron \\u2014 was the well-off Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who treated her almost as a daughter. The new arrival attended services at NGUC: she was a lifelong Anglican, but, in keeping with the church's and Price's ethos of logical enquiry and individual conscience, believers of all kinds were welcomed without any expectation of conversion. The approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women, and in her hour of need proved kinder to her than her own family. She, an unmarried woman making her own way in the world, was marginal to the dominant society in just the same way that the Dissenters were.</p>\\n<p>Wollstonecraft was then a young schoolmistress, as yet unpublished, but Price saw something in her worth fostering, and became a friend and mentor. Through the minister (and through the young Anglican John Hewlett, who also introduced her to the eminent lexicographer Samuel Johnson), she met the great humanitarian and radical publisher Joseph Johnson, who was to guide her career and serve as a father figure. Through him, with a title alluding to the husband of her other benefactor, she published <i>Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</i> (subtitled: <i>with reflections on female conduct, in the more important duties of life</i>). The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she had had to leave Newington Green, these seeds germinated into <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</i>, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women: Her biographer Claire Tomalin argues that just as the Dissenters were \\\"excluded as a class from education and civil rights by a lazy-minded majority\\\", so too were women, and the \\\"character defects of both groups\\\" could be attributed to this discrimination.</p>\\n<h3>Joseph Towers</h3>\\n\\n<p>It would have been hard for anyone to step into the shoes of Dr Price, but the minister from 1778 to his death in 1799 was a remarkable character in his own right. Joseph Towers was born in about 1738, the son of a poor bookseller, and was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Goadby of Sherborne. Lacking formal education, he read all he could and educated himself, eventually writing learned works such as <i>Criminal Libel and the Duty of Juries</i>, and being awarded a Doctor of Law degree by Edinburgh University. Towers assisted fellow minister Andrew Kippis in developing the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>, a forerunner of the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. He was secretary of the highly respectable Society for Constitutional Information, which lobbied for political liberties, but it was suppressed by the authorities, who lived in fear of the Reign of Terror crossing the Channel. Towers was put under arrest until the Archbishop of Canterbury intervened on his behalf.</p>\\n<h2>Early nineteenth century: The Barbaulds</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister, first as the morning preacher. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\\u20131825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth. She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father John Aikin was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, \\\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\\". Two years later she wrote <i>The Rights of Women</i>, but this was not published until her death thirty years later.</p>\\n<p>Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife, and committed suicide by drowning himself in the New River that runs through Islington. Anna remained a member of the congregation until her death and is commemorated in the church with a plaque which praises her work for \\\"the Cause of Humanity, Peace, and Justice, [and] of Civil and Religious Liberty\\\". Her brother Dr John Aikin lived nearby, and together they co-authored books such as <i>Evenings at Home</i>. As he had been a Unitarian minister in his youth, it is likely that he worshipped at NGUC, with his son Arthur, a prominent scientist, and his daughter Lucy, a biographer. They lived in a house previously occupied by Adam Anderson, clerk to the South Sea Company.</p>\\n<h2>Early nineteenth century: legal acceptance</h2>\\n<p>Thomas Rees took over after Barbauld's death. He was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. In 1813 two things occurred, key to the understanding of the development of the church: Parliament passed the Doctrine of the Trinity Act, and Rees was succeeded by James Gilchrist, who remained for 15 years. (His son Alexander wrote the standard biography of poet and artist William Blake.) The larger public event meant that the civil and religious liberties that Dissenters had been fighting for were won, the battle of a century and a half was over. The more particular event sowed its own seeds of destruction, as Gilchrist gradually changed his opinions and eventually wrote a pamphlet called \\\"Unitarianism Abandoned\\\", which infuriated his very Unitarian congregation. For a long time he refused to resign, but in the end he was forced out, and the church built a safeguard against such a future occurrence by holding annual elections for the minister. NGUC then entered a very low ebb, with at one point as few as nine subscribers and a rapid turnover of ministers. The causes it had agitated for had been successful, and the church looked backwards with pride, but saw little to look forward to. Energy drained away. \\\"Legal recognition did not prosper the cause of the church, however, which at this time began to decline.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>Mid-nineteenth century: social challenges</h2>\\n<p>\\\"New causes and fresh ideals were needed to revitalise the church, and, fortunately, they were forthcoming.\\\" The nature of Newington Green had changed\\u2014the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a \\\"thriving and expanding suburb\\\". With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839\\u201364) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792\\u20131870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.)</p>\\n<p>A charity school for 14 girls and a monitorial Sunday school for 150 children had been set up in the vicinity by Dissenters in 1790 and 1808 respectively, but these efforts were augmented in the middle of the century. In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870.</p>\\n<p>One of the first actions of Cromwell's tenure, in terms of changing the church services, was to introduce the hymnbook of James Martineau. Samuel Sharpe, named after his uncle, the poet Samuel Rogers, came to Newington Green in 1828, and maintained his connection for 30 years, sometimes as treasurer. He was an erudite and generous man, and in 1870 he was elected Chairman of the British and Foreign Unitarian Society. Andrew Pritchard (1804\\u20131882) was treasurer of NGUC 1850-73, during which time donations doubled. He was a microscope and slide maker who made significant improvements to microscopy and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society. The \\\"small but energetic community\\\" continued to campaign on the larger political stage, presenting petitions to Parliament on subjects touching religious matters, such as the Dissenting Chapels Bill (made law as Nonconformists Chapels Act 1844), the removal of civil disabilities from the Jews (1847), permission for Dissenters to attend Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and the revision of the King James Bible. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords.</p>\\n<h2>Later nineteenth century: towards the high water</h2>\\n<p>NGUC thrived during the last decades of the nineteenth century, and its congregation grew to 80\\u00a0subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at NGUC as the best in its class, educating up to 200\\u00a0children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprung up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young Men's and Young Women's groups met, as did the Mothers' Meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform, and women's suffrage.</p>\\n<p>Sister and brother Marian and Ion Pritchard continued the work of their father. The cause of liberal religion in general, and the development of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, were overarching themes. Marian in particular is described as an unsung heroine, and \\\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\\". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers, and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.</p>\\n<h2>Early twentieth century: wars and crises</h2>\\n<p>Thorncroft, author of the church's semiquincentennial history, <i>Trust in Freedom</i>, concludes that NGUC reached its high-water mark at its bicentenary in 1908. Immediately after this, NGUC suffered a religious schism in miniature, when the incoming minister, Dr F. W. G. Foat, backed the New Theology of Reginald John Campbell and the League of Progressive Thought and Service. This Social Gospel movement was not to the taste of all his congregants, and Foat left for the Richmond Free Christian Church. Then came 1914, and Christian faith all over the world was shaken by the horrors of World War I. Unitarians as a body have never been pacifists, unlike the Quakers, and some fifteen members of the congregation and Sunday School fell during the war. Society as a whole found less solace in religion, perhaps particularly liberal religion, with its message of human dignity ringing hollow beside the great guns. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. Numbers in the pews dropped. By 1930 \\\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\\".</p>\\n<p>Nonetheless, survive it did. One influential supporter was an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington, and in 1938 a new lay pastor and his family breathed new life into the church. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths, an organisation founded by Francis Younghusband. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the Mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.</p>\\n<h2>Later twentieth century/early twenty-first century: rejuvenation</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the late twentieth century, faced with declining numbers, Newington Green Unitarian Church developed closer ties with Islington Unitarian Church a couple of km away. They started to share a minister and publicise events together under the name New Unity, while remaining legally distinct entities. The 1969 sale of the (New) Gravel Pit Chapel near the centre of the historic village of Hackney released funding via the Charity Commission for maintenance of the Newington Green chapel.</p>\\n<p>By the turn of the millennium, NGUC's community was reduced in numbers. A small congregation of half a dozen elderly women persisted, and a new burst of energy arrived with the appointment of Cathal (Cal) Courtney, first as student pastor in 2002 and then as minister in July 2004. He came from an Ireland of divided communities; he was characterised as a \\\"radical spirit\\\" who had made a \\\"remarkable spiritual journey\\\", and his weekly sermons soon attracted twenty people. In the tradition of Unitarian social action, he led a silent vigil through the night before the huge march against the Iraq War, \\\"protesting against the US-led incursion with, among others, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and Jews present\\\" Later made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, during his time at NGUC he wrote <i>Towards Beloved Community</i> and was written about as the Right-On Reverend in <i>The Oldie'</i>s monthly \\\"East of Islington\\\" column.</p>\\n<p>The incumbent is Andrew Pakula, an American who grew up in a Jewish family in New York. His MIT doctorate in biology and master's degree in business led to his first career in biotechnology management and business development, before he undertook ministerial training, completing his studies at Unitarian College, Manchester. He began serving in October 2006, was inducted as full minister in January 2010, and was elected to the executive committee of the British Unitarians. He was described\\u00a0\\u2013 sympathetically\\u00a0\\u2013 in the local press as \\\"controversial\\\" when he did a reverse collection plate, giving his own money away to those attending one sermon.</p>\\n<h3>Richard Price Memorial Lecture</h3>\\n<p>Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981. NGUC now sponsors it annually, to address \\\"a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics\\\". In September 2003 the first of the new series took place under the auspices of the Stoke Newington Unitarian Conference, where Barbara Taylor, author of <i>Mary Wollstonecraft and the Feminist Imagination</i>, spoke on \\\"Radical Dissent and Women's Rights in Eighteenth-Century Britain\\\". In 2005 Will Self addressed the need to disestablish the Church of England  under the title \\\"Why Religion Needs Satire\\\". The November 2008 lecture took the theme of \\\"Dishonesty\\\": Evan Davis, the economist and BBC presenter, used the platform to argue that \\\"the media industry has a 'misleading ethical code' and tendency to be dishonest\\\". The 2009 lecture, given on 27 January 2010, was given by psychotherapist Susie Orbach, who spoke on the topic \\\"Frankenstein's Bodies Today\\\". The 2010 lecture was given by literary critic Terry Eagleton, who spoke on \\\"The New Atheism and the War on Terror\\\". In 2011 Wendy Savage, a doctor and long-time campaigner for women's reproductive health, spoke on \\\" Patients' Choice and Doctors' Responsibilities\\\".</p>\\n<h3>Stance on gay marriage</h3>\\n<p>In March 2008, Newington Green Unitarian Church became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until all couples have equal marriage rights. Unity Church Islington followed suit a couple of months later. Pakula stated that same-sex couples \\\"are being treated like second-class citizens when they are forbidden to celebrate their unions in a way that heterosexual couples take for granted\\\". The BBC called it a \\\"gay rights church\\\" for its unanimous committee vote suspending full wedding services, although NGUC is not a \\\"gay church\\\" such as the Metropolitan Community Church, and it still conducts ceremonial blessings of relationships, straight and gay. The church's decision was in response to the case brought by the Christian Institute, backing the claim of Lillian Ladele, a registrar employed by Islington London Borough Council who wished to be exempted from having to perform civil partnership ceremonies on the grounds of her religion. The move was praised by Rev. Richard Kirker, chairman of the national Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. \\\"This is the first church I\\u2019ve heard of to have taken this step\\\", he said. \\\"We\\u2019re proud that Islington is striking a blow for human rights.\\\" Following in the steps of his immediate predecessor, who used his inaugural column in the <i>N16 magazine</i> to address the international furore around Gene Robinson's election as bishop, Pakula sees homophobia as the real problem, and his congregation did consider challenging the law under the European Convention on Human Rights. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called on the church to conduct a gay marriage in defiance of the law.</p>\\n<h3>Tercentenary celebrations</h3>\\n<p>NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan \\\"300 years of dissent\\\", marking this with events such as planting a crab apple tree, organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of Ottoman classical music. (There is a strong Turkish community in Newington Green and along the nearest section of Green Lanes, an ancient road which starts from the northwest corner of the Green.)</p>\\n<h3>250th anniversary of Wollstonecraft's birth</h3>\\n<p>The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft, attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the \\\"birthplace of feminism\\\", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there. NGUC sponsored a series of events, including a return visit and lecture by biographer Barbara Taylor; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians Diane Abbott MP, Jean Lambert MEP, and Emily Thornberry MP; an art exhibition titled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring Carol Grimes and Adey Grummet, to raise money for Stop the Traffik, an anti-trafficking charity; a tombstone tribute at St Pancras Old Church; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.</p>\\n<p>Pakula's sermon in honour of the Wollstonecraft anniversary stressed her role as a prophet. This excerpt serves as a flavour of the emphasis given to social action within the church:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Mary Wollstonecraft was a unique individual\\u00a0\\u2013 brilliant and strong. She was one who would not be swept along in stream of the common beliefs and understandings of her time. Hers was a keener sight\\u00a0\\u2013 a vision that saw beyond what most people take for granted. She saw, contrary to the assumptions of her time, that women were the equals of men. Her bold stance\\u00a0\\u2013 a position that proved to be many years ahead of her time\\u00a0\\u2013 was met with broad condemnation. Today, we recognise that Mary Wollstonecraft spoke with the voice of prophesy. We honour her for her courage and for the gifts she has given to future generations of women and men.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Regular and occasional activities</h3>\\n<p>Sunday services alternate between NGUC and its Islington sister, including special events such as the yearly Flower Communion; twice-monthly poetry readings and weekly meditation sessions are held at Newington Green. It participates in the annual festival of architecture, Open House London. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, which \\\"performs West Gallery Music, the psalmody heard in parish churches and non-conformist chapels during the Georgian period, from about 1720 to 1850\\\", and the Psallite Women's Choir. The congregation was reported to have grown to 70 as of 2009, with 30 at one Sunday service; it is one of the most rapidly growing Unitarian churches in Britain.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce.

It gives its name to the surrounding area, roughly bounded by Ball's Pond Road to the south, Petherton Road to the west, the southern section of Stoke Newington with Green Lanes, Matthias Road to the north, and Boleyn Road to the east. The Green itself is in N16 and the area is covered by the N16, N1 and N5 postcodes.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origins</h2>\\n<p>The first record of the area is as 'Neutone' in the Domesday Survey of 1086, when it still formed part of the demesne of St Paul\\u2019s Cathedral. The thirteenth century saw Newton become Newington, whilst the prefix 'Stoke' was added in the area to the north, distinguishing it from Newington Barrow or Newington Berners in Islington. Newington Barrow later became known as Highbury, after the manor house built on a hill.</p>\\n<p>There was probably a medieval settlement, and the prevailing activity was agriculture, growing hay and food for the inhabitants of nearby London. By the 15th century the area had become more prosperous and in 1445 there were a good number of Londoners living in the hamlet. The name Newington Green was first mentioned in 1480. By the 1490s it was fringed by cottages, homesteads and crofts on the three sides in Newington Barrow manor in Islington. The north side was divided between the manors of Stoke Newington and Brownswood in South Hornsey.</p>\\n<h2>Royal visitors and ministers</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the 16th century the area was connected to the court of Henry VIII. The king himself used a house on the south side of the Green as a base for hunting the wild bulls, stags and wild boars that roamed the surrounding forest.</p>\\n<p>In 1523 a resident of the north side of the Green, the future 6th Earl of Northumberland, Henry Percy became engaged to Anne Boleyn. At the time he was page to Cardinal Wolsey. Lord Percy had not sought permission from either his father or the king, causing Wolsey to scold him and his father to refuse the marriage. He later found himself a member of the jury that convicted Anne of adultery. His home, Brook House, stood at the northeast corner of the square. It contained a central courtyard and was decorated with gilded and painted wainscotting. It was later demolished, renamed Bishop's Place, and divided into tenements for the poor.</p>\\n<p>In 1535 Henry VIII's chief minister (i.e. prime minister), Thomas Cromwell, took up residence at Canonbury Tower to the south of the area, from where he organised the Dissolution of the Monasteries and their transfer into royal ownership. (Just a year later Cromwell was accused of treason and executed on spurious evidence.) Other Tower residents included, in the 16th century, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick and afterwards Duke of Northumberland, general, admiral, and politician; in the 17th century, Francis Bacon, the father of the scientific method, at that time the Attorney General, and Sir Thomas Coventry, afterwards Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith, the writer.</p>\\n<h2>Samuel Pepys</h2>\\n<p>The famous 17th century diarist Samuel Pepys was sent to the Newington Green and Kingsland area by his mother in order to benefit from the fresh air and open spaces of what was a rural area at that time.</p>\\n<h2>Mildmay</h2>\\n<p>Newington Green's history is marked by several streets in the area taking their name from this period, such as King Henry\\u2019s Walk, Boleyn Road (formerly Ann Boleyn\\u2019s Walk), Wolsey Road and Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s Walk. Many other thoroughfares are named after the Mildmay estate, including Mildmay Park, Mildmay Grove North and Mildmay Grove South. Sir Walter Mildmay was the Chancellor of the Exchequer under Elizabeth I. He was one of the special commissioners in the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, and founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584.</p>\\n<p>His grandson Sir Henry Mildmay served as MP and was Master of the Jewel House for Charles I. Henry was critical of the king's religious policies, supported Parliament during the civil wars and attended the king's trial. After the Restoration Henry was arrested for his part in the regicide, but granted leniency because he had refused to sign the king's death warrant. Instead of the death penalty he was sent to the Tower of London, stripped of his knighthood and his estates and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\\n<p>Mildmay Mission Hospital was founded in the 1890s, inspired by the work of the Reverend William Pennefather during the cholera epidemic of 1866. It was absorbed into the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and in the 1980s began pioneering work into the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS, which it continues.</p>\\n<p>Mildmay Park, located on the street of the same name, was a station on the North London Railway. Opened in 1880, it closed in 1934. The station building was demolished in 1987, but remnants of the platforms can still be seen at track level.</p>\\n<h2>Nonconformists and the Dissenting Academies</h2>\\n<p>The area became the home of English Dissenters during the 17th century. Following the religious upheavals after the Restoration, some Protestants chose to remain in England and maintain their faith openly, but they had to live with the restrictions the state placed upon them. They moved to places tolerant of them; often they set up educational establishments, known in general as dissenting academies, which were intellectually and morally more rigorous than the universities. One such place was Newington Green, then still an agricultural village, but conveniently near London.) Oliver Cromwell's family had links there: his great-granddaughter Mary was born at the Green on 11 April 1691.</p>\\n<p>A critical mass of \\\"dissident intellectuals, pedagogues with reforming ideas and Dissenters\\\" and \\\"the well-to-do edge of radical Protestantism\\\" clustered around Newington Green, and other villages nearby such as Stoke Newington and Hackney. Not all of these free-thinkers were Unitarians: other notables include the Quaker physician John Coakley Lettsome and the Anglican pacifist Vicesimus Knox.</p>\\n<p>One such academy was set up on north of the Green, run by Charles Morton. One of the academy's students was Daniel Defoe, the writer, journalist and spy famous for his novel <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>. Another pupil was the controversial poet Samuel Wesley, father of John Wesley, the great religious leader. A later schoolmaster was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to the church there.</p>\\n<h2>Unitarian Church, Price and Wollstonecraft</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1708 the Newington Green Unitarian Church was built on the north, Hackney side of the Green. That congregation continues today as New Unity. The minister whose name is still remembered centuries later is Dr Richard Price, a libertarian and republican who cemented the village's <i>\\\"reputation as a centre for radical thinkers and social reformers\\\"</i>. He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658). A large number of important politicians, thinkers, reformers, and writers visited him at Newington Green, including Founding Fathers of the United States, British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as <i>\\\"Citizen Stanhope\\\"</i>), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt\\u00a0; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb. Price was fortunate in forming close friendships among his neighbours and congregants. One was Thomas Rogers, father of poet and banker Samuel Rogers, a merchant turned banker who had married into a long-established Dissenting family and lived at No. 56 the Green. Another was the Rev. James Burgh, author of <i>The Dignity of Human Nature</i> and <i>Thoughts on Education</i>, who opened his Dissenting Academy on the green in 1750 and sent his pupils to Price's sermons. Price, Rogers, and Burgh formed a dining club, eating at each other's houses in rotation. When Joseph Priestley's support of dissent led to the riots named after him, he fled Birmingham and headed for the sanctuary of Newington Green, where Rogers took him in.</p>\\n<p>Arguably the most important resident of the Green was the early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, who moved her fledgling school for girls from Islington to Newington Green in 1784, with the help of a fairy godmother. This was Mrs Burgh, widow of the educationalist, who used her influence to find the young schoolmistress a house to rent and twenty students to fill it. The flavour of the village and the approach of these Rational Dissenters appealed to Wollstonecraft: they were hard-working, humane, critical but uncynical, and respectful towards women. The ideas Wollstonecraft ingested from the sermons at NGUC pushed her towards a political awakening. A couple of years after she left Newington Green, these seeds germinated into <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Men</i>, a response to Burke's denunciation of the French Revolution and attack on Price. In 1792 she published the work for which she is best remembered, <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, in the spirit of rationalism extending Price's arguments about equality to women. Newington Green had made its mark on Mary, and through this founding work of feminist philosophy, on the world.</p>\\n<h2>The New River</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1602 it was proposed that a new river should be constructed to provide London with its first clean, fresh water. Sir Hugh Myddleton, a Welsh goldsmith and philanthropist, was given the responsibility, and in 1609 he built a canal from the Hertfordshire rivers of Chadwell and Amwell, 38 miles to the New River Head Reservoir at Amwell Street in Clerkenwell. Originally open to the air, the aqueduct flowed down the centre of the present day Petherton Road. It was later covered for sanitary reasons.</p>\\n<p>In 1808, Rochemont Barbauld was appointed minister to Newington Green Unitarian Church. His wife, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\\u20131825), was a prolific writer, admired by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth. She enjoyed a long friendship with Joseph Priestley and William Enfield, starting from their years together at the Warrington Academy in the 1760s, where her father was tutor. She wrote poems (including a tribute to Priestley), hymns, children's literature, and political and religious tracts. She was an abolitionist, addressing one of her works to William Wilberforce. 1793 saw her contribution to the Pamphlet War, <i>\\\"Sins of the Government, Sins of the Nation\\\"</i>. Two years later she wrote <i>The Rights of Women</i>, but this was not published until her death thirty years later. Rochemont eventually went violently insane, attacked his wife and committed suicide by drowning himself in the river.</p>\\n<p>In 1946 the supply was redirected at Stoke Newington and in 1990 the New River was replaced by deep mains. Part of the New River\\u2019s original course through Canonbury has now been turned into an ornamental walk.</p>\\n<h2>Synagogues and Jewish life</h2>\\n\\n<p>Other religious institutions existed nearby. Jews fleeing the pogroms of the Russian Empire established a congregation by 1876, and built the Dalston Synagogue in adjoining Poets Road in 1885. This became one of the leading synagogues of London, with Jacob Koussevitzsky as its cantor from 1936.</p>\\n<p>For a period from the end of the nineteenth century, the Newington Green Area was host to a large Jewish population, which was beginning to leave the East End and move northwards towards Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill. The original Adath Israel orthodox congregation was founded in 1911 and its first permanent building was in Alma Road, off Green Lanes, before moving on towards Stoke Newington and the other side of Clissold Park in the 1950s. A large United Synagogue was built in Poets Road in the 1870s and remained active until it closed down in the late 1960s, as the remaining Jewish population moved on further afield. At its height, the Poets Road Synagogue (or as it was known the Dalston Synagogue despite the fact that it was not in Dalston - well, in fact, it was originally very close to Dalson Junction Station) had hundreds of worshippers (unlikely as it had only 400 male members at that time  and, for a short while in the 1930s, was the home of one of the world's leading cantors, a member of the Kusevitsky family.</p>\\n<p>The synagogue site was eventually sold and the beautiful building, along with its stained glass windows, was demolished in 1970 and replaced by a block of council flats, leaving no trace of the Jewish life which existed in this area.</p>\\n<h2>19th century</h2>\\n<p>The early part of the 19th century saw a change in the character of Newington Green. After a patient struggle of 150 years, the English Dissenters were finally freed from their civil disabilities with the passage of the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813. With, it seemed, nothing left to fight for on that front, Nonconformists no longer needed the security of the Newington Green, and the area lost some of its intellectual cohesiveness. The church touched a low point. The nature of Newington Green had changed\\u2014the fresh bucolic village had been swallowed up by London's relentless growth, and had become a <i>\\\"thriving and expanding suburb\\\"</i>. With this growth of prosperity also came a tide of poverty, and this was to prove the mission for the Victorian era. A hundred years before, the ethos had been one of almost Puritan self-reliance, but now the Dickensian poverty, evident in cholera epidemics and rampant malnutrition, made social responsibility an urgent necessity. The minister who guided the first 25 years of this (1839\\u201364) was Thomas Cromwell, FSA (1792\\u20131870). (Like many Anglican vicars, one of his hobbies was local history.) In 1840, a Sunday school was set up for poor children, and soon thereafter a Domestic Mission Society, to visit the poor in their homes. A library and a savings club emphasised self-help. A regular day school ran from 1860 for ten years, until primary education became the responsibility of the state with the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870.</p>\\n<p>The <i>\\\"small but energetic community\\\"</i> continued to campaign on the larger political stage. Religious freedom and self-improvement were their watchwords. In the last decades of the 19th century, the church thrived and its congregation grew to 80 subscribers. The London Sunday School Society recognised the one at Newington Green as the best in its class, educating up to 200 children and necessitating the construction in 1887 of the schoolhouse immediately behind the main church building. A range of groups sprang up, ranging from intellectual (a Society for Mutual Theological Study) to recreational (cycling and cricket). Young men's and young women's groups met, as did the mothers' meeting, a Provident Society, and teetotalism (abstinence from alcohol) support for adults and children. Other issues of concern were education, social reform and women's suffrage.</p>\\n<p>Some individuals who lived at the Green during this period included Thomas Rees, the minister after Barbauld, who was a leading authority of the history of Unitarianism, and made connections with the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. Alexander Gilchrist, son of another minister, was the biographer of William Blake. Andrew Pritchard improved the microscope and studied microscopic organisms; he was a friend of Michael Faraday and for him, science and religion were one. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society. Marian Pritchard is described as an unsung heroine, and <i>\\\"one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism\\\"</i>. She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home. John Stuart Mill recalls his family living in Newington Green \\\"from 1810 to the end of 1813\\\"; it was at the time <i>\\\"an almost rustic neighbourhood\\\"</i>, and it was during walks with his father before breakfast <i>\\\"generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey\\\"</i> (<i>\\\"my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers\\\"</i>) that John Stuart would recount to James Mill what he had learnt reading the previous day.</p>\\n<h2>20th century</h2>\\n<p>Then came 1914, and the horrors of World War I. Men from Newington Green fell in battle. Meanwhile, many of the older people with long family ties to Newington Green simply died. The professional middle class had largely left the area. By 1930 <i>\\\"it was whispered that the church could not survive\\\"</i>, but it did, with an influential supporter, an alderman and councillor in the Borough of Stoke Newington. Although attendance at services was low, other activities drew in crowds: 100 to the temperance meetings, for example. The outbreak of World War II meant that children were evacuated temporarily from London, so the Sunday Schools and Young People's Leagues ceased for a time. The Sunday services never missed a week, however, even when the building was badly damaged by a landmine blast: they just moved to the schoolhouse. After the war, the ministry focused on building bridges between races and faiths, e.g. with the Jewish community of North London, and was recognised by the World Congress of Faiths. Services were often attended by local politicians, including the mayor of Stoke Newington. Leaders for the national Unitarian movement continued to be found within the congregation at Newington Green.</p>\\n<h2>Newington Green today</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Green, far from being a pleasant and well-manicured garden square, was for many years just a run-down green space that straddled the border between Islington N1 and Hackney N16. However, in 1979 the Newington Green Action Group (NGAG) was formed with the aim of regenerating the area. NGAG worked with Islington Council on this project and traffic calming measures were installed to ease the notorious local congestion, with additional pedestrian crossings providing easier and safer access to the Green on foot. The Green itself was regenerated to include more lawn space, a play area and a caf\\u00e9. New planting has enhanced the Green and was chosen to encourage biodiversity.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green has grown in popularity with the local community, evinced by the children that now play in the formerly deserted park, which is once more being used like a village green. Community groups hold fairs on the Green and NGAG has organised many events including the annual Jazz on the Green and Open Garden Squares day. These improvements are such that in 2006, Newington Green won the first of many Green Flag Awards (the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales, sponsored by Keep Britain Tidy). It has also won the Green Heritage Site Award for several years running, which is sponsored by English Heritage. In 2010 NGAG teamed up with the Mayville Gardening Club and the King Henry's Walk Community Garden; the Newington Green area was awarded a High Silver Gilt Royal Horticultural Society Urban Communities Award, as part of the London in Bloom Scheme.</p>\\n<p>The Newington Green Action Group also published a local history book <i>The Village That Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce in 2008, which won the Walter Bor Award the following year.</p>\\n<p>Newington Green and Newington Green Road to the south constitute the commercial and cultural centre of the district. This area shares in the gentrification of Islington and Stoke Newington, so the old shopping area has now been supplemented by a number of new and trendy shops, bars and restaurants. However, there is a substantial Turkish Cypriot community in the area, members of whom run many of the local grocery stores.</p>\\n<p>Since the millennium, two new ministers at the Unitarian Church have injected energy into the Green and added to its events and publicity. Cathal (Cal) Courtney, characterised as a \\\"radical spirit\\\" who had made a \\\"remarkable spiritual journey\\\", opened the church for a multi-faith silent protest vigil through the night before the huge march against the Iraq War. He used his inaugural column in the <i>N16 magazine</i> to address the international furore around Gene Robinson's election as bishop. He was written about as the Right-On Reverend in <i>The Oldie'</i>s monthly \\\"East of Islington\\\" column. Courtney revived the Richard Price Memorial Lecture, which had last been given in 1981. NGUC now sponsors it annually, to \\\"(address) a topical or important aspect of liberty, reason and ethics.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The current minister is Andrew (Andy) Pakula, an American who grew up in a secular Jewish family in New York. Newington Green Unitarian Church made history when it became the first religious establishment in Britain to refuse to carry out any weddings at all until same-sex couples have the right to full legal marriage. The BBC called it a \\\"gay rights church\\\" for its unanimous committee vote suspending full wedding services.</p>\\n<p>NGUC celebrated its tercentenary in 2008 under the slogan \\\"300 years of dissent\\\", marking this with events such as planting a crab apple tree, organising a picnic in conjunction with the Newington Green Action Group, and hosting a concert of Ottoman classical music. (Newington Green has a strong Turkish population.) The following year it commemorated the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mary Wollstonecraft, attaching a large banner to the railings outside the building, proclaiming it the \\\"birthplace of feminism\\\", in a nod to the formative years that she spent worshipping there. NGUC sponsored a series of events, including a return visit and lecture by biographer Barbara Taylor; a panel discussion about women and power, between female politicians Diane Abbott MP, Jean Lambert MEP, and Emily Thornberry MP; an art exhibition entitled Mother of Feminism; a concert featuring Carol Grimes and Adey Grummet to raise money for Stop the Traffik, an anti-trafficking charity; a tombstone tribute at St Pancras Old Church; a birthday cake baked by men; and other activities.</p>\\n<p>Weekly poetry readings are held at NGUC. It participates in the annual festival of architecture, Open House London. It hosts occasional concerts, such as that given by the London Gallery Quire, and the Psallite Women's Choir.</p>\\n<h2>Cafe and building in the park</h2>\\n<p>In July 2013 a new cafe called \\\"Lizzy's on the Green\\\" opened in the kiosk on the green.</p>\\n<h2>Listed buildings</h2>\\n\\n<p>This outlying area of Islington carries a surprising wealth of historic architecture and Newington Green has become a conservation area. On the west side of the Green (numbers 52-55) is London's oldest surviving brick terrace, which is Grade I listed. These were built in 1658, and 100 years later were home to Price and Rogers. Shop fronts were added to all of them in the 1880s, but have now been removed on three of the houses, presumably restoring something like their original appearance. Residential London, particularly outside Westminster and the City, is essentially a 19th-century city. Even in the centre, there are no brick houses this old, pre-dating the Great Fire of 1666. Two of the properties have been extensively renovated under the guidance of Bere Architects (Islington).</p>\\n<p>The Green also has two Grade II listed buildings. To the north is the Unitarian Church, which celebrated its tercentenary in 2008. The original 1708 building was financed with \\u00a3300 from goldsmith Edward Harrison. It was a <i>\\\"substantial brick building, of nearly square form, with the high, tiled, projecting roof, common at its era\\\"</i>. <i>\\\"Historic views show that the original fa\\u00e7ade had a small pediment against a large hipped roof, with a central oval window below.\\\"</i> This building was substantially extended and improved in the mid-19th century. An internal gallery was built to increase the seating available, and a few years later the roof and apse were renewed, and a <i>\\\"stuccoed frontage\\\"</i> was built, <i>\\\"mirrroring the original fa\\u00e7ade with a three-bay front with two round-headed windows, but with added Tuscan pilasters and a large pediment\\\"</i>. In the mid-20th century, the building was damaged by enemy action. In 1953 its architectural importance was recognised as a Grade II listed building.</p>\\n<p>To the west is its neighbour, the former headquarters of the China Inland Mission, an organisation founded by James Hudson Taylor in 1865 and responsible for 18,000 converts to Christianity.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Further reading</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16</i> by Alex Allardyce.</li>\\n<li><i>Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft</i> by Lyndall Gordon.

It is bounded by Hackney Road to the south, Kingsland Road to the west, Middleton Road to the north, with London Fields and Broadway Market to the east. In the 1990s a number of the area's more rundown housing estates were refurbished and some disused public buildings were privately converted into gated communities.</p>\\n<p>The area has the 9th highest crime rate in Hackney. [1]</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origin</h2>\\n\\n<p>Haggerston is first recorded in the Domesday Book as <i>Hergotestane</i>, possibly of Viking origin, and an outlying hamlet of Shoreditch. On Rocque's 1745 map of Hackney, the village is shown as <i>Agostone</i> but by the 19th century it had become part of the growing urban sprawl, with factories and streets of workers' cottages lining the canal.</p>\\n<h2>Today</h2>\\n<p>The proximity to Hoxton and Shoreditch has made the area popular with students and workers in the creative industries, as these nearby areas have grown more expensive. In recent years, escalating property prices have driven commercial art galleries further into east London, which has exacerbated this effect.</p>\\n<p>A shortage of secondary school places has made the area less attractive to families but this is likely to change with the building of a City Academy on Laburnum Street.</p>\\n<p>Many Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian people have formed communities in Haggerston and nearby Shoreditch. Outside the area, the most visible sign of this is the profusion of Southeast Asian restaurants on nearby Kingsland Road in Shoreditch and on Mare Street in Hackney. There is also a notable Russian community focused on bars and caf\\u00e9s along Kingsland Road.</p>\\n<h2>Amenities</h2>\\n\\n<p>Besides the Regents Canal, Haggerston Park, on the site of a demolished gasworks on Hackney Road, provides much-needed open space in the area. Also in the area is the Hackney City Farm. The Regent Estate provides the Regent Estate Pensioners Club/Hall and the Regent Estate Community Center/Hall which together provide community services and spaces for hire. The Regent Estate Pensioners Hall is also used as a Polling Station.</p>\\n<p>The Grade II listed Haggerston Pool, designed by Alfred Cross and opened in 1904, was closed in 2000. In June 2009, after a long community campaign, a \\u00a35m grant was announced from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to refurbish and re-open the pool. The building would also contain community facilities and a GP surgery.</p>\\n<p>Haggerston School is a Grade II listed building, designed by modernist architect Ern\\u0151 Goldfinger and built in 1964\\u201365.</p>\\n<p>This area of Hackney has a long association with clowning. Holy Trinity Church still hosts an annual clowns' service to commemorate Joseph Grimaldi and All Saints Centre at one time housed the Clowns Gallery and Museum, including props and a unique collection of painted eggs, serving as the 'registration' of clowns' make-up. Much of the collection is now on display at Wookey Hole. Other Anglican churches in Haggerston are All Saints, Haggerston Road; St Columba, Kingsland Road; and Sts Mary and Chad, Nichols Square.</p>\\n<h2>Ward</h2>\\n<p>The Haggerston electoral ward forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.</p>\\n<p>The ward returns three councillors to Hackney Council, with an election every four years. At the election on 6 May 2010, Ann Munn, Jonathan McShane, and Barry Buitekant, all Labour Party candidates, were returned.

In 2009 artists Andrea Luka Zimmerman and Lasse Johansson, who lived on the Haggerston Estate on Dunston Road, created the I AM HERE project, placing on the building large portrait photographs of the current estate residents who were about to be moved out so the building could be demolished. These faced the Regent's Canal and were popular with passersby. The project came down in April 2014.</p>\\n<p>On the Kingsland Estate in Whiston Road, Egyptian painter Nazir Tanbouli created the \\\"King's Land\\\" project where, in the space of 4 months, he covered all of the buildings of the condemned estate with murals.

Goldfinger knew both architects personally. The elevations of the school follow the mathematical proportions of the Golden Section and it includes a double-height circulation spine with balcony.

It is roughly in the area between Essex Road, Upper Street and Cross Street and either side of St Paul's Road. In 1253 land in the area was granted to the Canons of St Bartholomew\\u2019s Priory, Smithfield and became known as Canonbury. The area continued predominantly as open land until it was developed as a suburb in the early 19th century. In common with similar inner London areas, it suffered decline when the construction of railways in the 1860s enabled commuting into the city from further afield. The gentrification of the area from the 1950s included new developments to replace war-damaged properties in Canonbury Park North and South as well as restoration of older buildings.</p>\\n<p>East Canonbury is the south-eastern corner of the district, bordering on the Regents Canal. Parts of this area were transferred to the district from the London Borough of Hackney in a boundary adjustment (along the line of the northern tow-path of the canal), in 1993.</p>\\n<p>In the east is the New River Estate (formerly the Marquess Estate), a 1,200 dwelling council estate, completed in 1976 on 26 acres (110,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>), and designed by Darbourne &amp; Darke. A dark red brick, traffic free estate, it was praised as an example of municipal architecture, but acquired a bad reputation and has since been extensively redeveloped to improve security for residents.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Literary and artistic connections</h2>\\n\\n<p>George Orwell moved to 27b Canonbury Square in the autumn of 1944 - he and his wife having been bombed out of their previous flat, in Mortimer Crescent, on 28 June 1944. Evelyn Waugh lived at 17a Canonbury Square from 1928 to 1930. Charles Dickens wrote a Christmas story about a lamplighter in Canonbury, which features the Tower. Leslie Forbes, the travel and detective story writer, and amateur historian Gavin Menzies both live in the area.</p>\\n<h2>Places of interest</h2>\\n<ul><li><b>Canonbury Tower</b> - The manor house of Canonbury was constructed by William Bolton of St Bartholomew\\u2019s Priory between 1509 and 1532. At the dissolution it was granted to Thomas Cromwell. In the 1590s the manor house was rebuilt by Sir John Spencer, Lord Mayor of the City of London, including the construction of its tower. The tower has been occupied by many historical figures, including Francis Bacon and Oliver Goldsmith. The Tower Theatre Company was based here from 1953 to 2003. It is currently used as a Masonic research centre.</li>\\n<li><b>Canonbury Square</b> - An attractive square, developed between 1805 and 1830, it includes a variety of distinct styles. In 1812, when few properties had been built, the New North Road turnpike, now known as Canonbury Road, was constructed and bisects the square. Many significant figures from the arts and literary worlds have lived on the square, including George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh and Samuel Phelps.</li>\\n<li><b>The Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art</b> is in Canonbury Square.</li>\\n<li><b>New River Walk</b> - The New River, an aqueduct built by Sir Hugh Myddelton to supply fresh water to London, was completed in 1613. The walk is in two parts, with a break at Willowbridge. The southern section received an early National Lottery grant, and has a back-pumping scheme which simulates the water flow of the original aqueduct.</li>\\n<li><b>Canonbury Grove</b> - a road running parallel to part of New River Walk, made up of typical attractive 2 and 3 storey early 19th century terraces.</li>\\n</ul><h2>Churches</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>St Paul's Church, Canonbury, is a fine building that has become somewhat dilapidated; it is used as a social centre and twinned with St Jude's church nearby.</li>\\n<li>St Stephen's Church, Church of England</li>\\n</ul><h2>Groups in Canonbury</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Greenpeace UK - offices based at Canonbury Villas.</li>\\n<li>The Canonbury Society [1] aims to conserve the special character of Canonbury by monitoring development</li>\\n<li>Islington &amp; Stoke Newington (T.S Quail) Sea Cadet Unit</li>\\n<li>The Islington Society [2] was founded in 1960 to safeguard and improve the quality of life in Islington.

The one-day event was held at the end of June 2003, on Clapham Common with a capacity of 10,000. Tickets for the event sold out in two days. The event consisted of one live main stage, three smaller dance stages plus bars and food stalls.</p>\\n<p>In 2004, the event was repeated with an expanded capacity of 20,000. The event sold out within three days. Lovebox also hosted a sister festival on Newcastle Racecourse followed by an after party.</p>\\n<p>In 2005, Lovebox moved to Victoria Park in Tower Hamlets. The festival expanded to two days and a capacity of 25,000. The event was co-headlined by Groove Armada and Mylo and featured four dance tents, two cabaret arenas, a 1900s Spiegel tent and a funfair.</p>\\n<p>From 2007 until 2008, Lovebox hosted a sister event in Dublin.</p>\\n<p>By 2009, Lovebox had increased to a capacity of 50,000 and a 40-acre (160,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) site.</p>\\n<p>Lovebox has also hosted nights at The End, Turnmills, Neighbourhood, Canvas, The Key and The Ministry of Sound in London and elsewhere in Brighton, Dublin, Belfast, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Ibiza, as well as an annual summer boat party, which ran until 2008.</p>\\n<p>For 2010, the festival has been expanded to a three-day event, notable however for the fact that Groove Armada are missing from the lineup.</p>\\n<p>Lovebox 2014 has been reduced back to a two-day event.</p>\\n<h2>Festival culture</h2>\\n<p>Despite starting out as a predominantly dance festival, Lovebox has since expanded to include a wide variety of musical genres including indie, rock, world and pop, as well as circus performers, cabaret and fringe acts. In 2009 the festival hosted seven stages, supported by various partnerships from brands including Gaymers Cider, Relentless and Rizla.</p>\\n<p>Lovebox is also known for being a very creative-led event, with stages and areas being elaborately built and dressed. The 2009 festival site featured a tree house, a bowling alley, a vintage fashion fair and a healing and massage area as well as several themed bars and eating areas.</p>\\n<p>Being based in central London, yet still encompassing many of the features of country-set events such as Glastonbury and Secret Garden Party, Lovebox has developed a reputation for being an \\u201curban-based-yet-rural-feeling, multi-dimensional festival \\u2013 without the camping or the endless tramping about.\\u201d The event is also fully accessible \\u2013 being set in a public park, Lovebox avoids many of the usual pitfalls that befall disabled attendees at other festivals \\u2013 and family friendly \\u2013 with a children\\u2019s area and family friendly performances on their Fringe stage.</p>\\n<p>The Lovebox Festival has won a selection of awards.

It stretches out across part of the East End of London, England bordering parts of Bethnal Green, Hackney, and Bow, such as along Old Ford Road, London E3 and Victoria Park Road E9. The park is entirely within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The park has two cafes, The Pavilion Cafe in the West and The Park Cafe in the East. There are two playgrounds, one on either side of the park, as well as sporting facilities and a skatepark in the East. The park is home to many historic artifacts and features and has decorative gardens and wilder natural areas as well as open grass lands. Victoria Park is also used as a concert venue and hosts many festivals each year. The park is approximately a mile away from the London Olympic Park. Owing to its proximity to the Olympic park, it became a venue for the BT London Live event along with Hyde Park during the London 2012 Olympic Games. The park has in recent years gone through a 12 million pound refurbishment and many of the park's old features have been reinstated or repaired.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Origins</h2>\\n<p>The Crown Estate purchased 218 acres (88\\u00a0ha) which were laid out by notable London planner and architect Sir James Pennethorne between 1842 and 1846. A part of the area was known as Bonner Fields, after Bishop Bonner, the last lord of the manor of Stepney. The land had originally been parkland, associated with the Bishop's Palace, but by the mid-1800s had been spoiled by the extraction of gravel, and clay for bricks.</p>\\n<p>It was opened to the public in 1845. This large park is reminiscent of Regent's Park (not least because the latter was designed by Pennethorne's teacher John Nash), though much less busy, and is considered by some as the finest park in the East End. It is bounded on two sides by canals: the Regent's Canal lies to the west, while its branch, once known as the Hertford Union Canal runs along the Southern edge of the park. There is a gate named after Edmund Bonner. Guarding the main entrance at Sewardstone Road are replica statues of the Dogs of Alcibiades, the originals of which stood here from 1912 to 2009 until vandalism led to their being removed, restored and rehoused elsewhere in the Park.</p>\\n\\n<p>Two pedestrian alcoves, surviving fragments of the old London Bridge, demolished in 1831, are located at the east end of the park near the Hackney Wick war memorial where they were placed in 1860. They were part of the 1760 refurbishment of the 600 year old bridge, by Sir Robert Taylor and George Dance the Younger, and provided protection for pedestrians on the narrow carriageway. The insignia of the Bridge Association can be seen inside these alcoves. The alcoves have been Grade II listed, since 1951.</p>\\n<p>The Lido opened in 1936 and reopened in 1952 following damage during the Second World War; it was closed in 1986 and demolished in 1990.</p>\\n<h2>The People's Park</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the latter half of the 19th Century, Victoria Park became an essential amenity for the working classes of the East End. For some East End children in the 1880s, this may have been the only large stretch of uninterrupted greenery they ever encountered. Facilities like the Bathing Pond (picture right)\\u00a0\\u2014later superseded by the park lido\\u2014would have introduced many to swimming in an era when many public baths (like that at Shacklewell) were still simply communal washing facilities.</p>\\n<p>Victoria Park's reputation as the 'People's Park' grew as it became a centre for political meetings and rallies of all stripes, perhaps exceeding in importance the more well-known Hyde Park in this regard. The park occupies the interface between Tower Hamlets\\u00a0\\u2014 sunk in poverty in the 19th century and with a strong tradition of socialist and revolutionary agitation\\u00a0\\u2014 and Hackney, more genteel, but heir to a centuries-old legacy of religious dissent and non-conformism that led to its own fierce brand of reformism. So it should come as no surprise that the scene at the numerous Speaker's Corners was a lively one.</p>\\n<p>Although any one could set up their own soapbox, the biggest crowds were usually drawn to 'star' socialist speakers such as William Morris and Annie Besant.</p>\\n\\n<p>This description by J. H. Rosney, correspondent for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> (February 1888) evokes a scene:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>On the big central lawn are scattered numerous groups, some of which are very closely packed. Almost all the religious sects of England and all the political and social parties are preaching their ideas and disputing [...]</p>\\n<p>On this lawn the listener, as his fancy prompts him, may assist on Malthusianism, atheism, agnosticism, secularism, Calvinism, socialism, anarchism, Salvationism, Darwinism, and even, in exceptional cases, Swedenborgianism and Mormonism. I once heard there a prophet, a man who professed to be inspired by the Holy Ghost; but this prophet ended by being locked up in an asylum, where he will have to convert the doctor before he can recover his liberty.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The tradition of public speaking in the park continued until well after the Second World War, and was still later reflected in politically oriented rock concerts, such as those held by Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League in the 1970s and 1980s. And it is still not uncommon for marches or demonstrations to begin or end in Victoria Park.</p>\\n<p>On 26th June 2014, a campaign to revive the Speakers' Corner at Victoria Park was launched at a democratic theatre event held in Shoreditch Town Hall. Hosted by The People Speak, a participatory campaign and events group, 66 audience members deliberated over how to used the pooled cash revenue from their tickets, and eventually voted to recreate the well-known tradition of free speech and debate in Hyde Park in East London's Victoria Park. The campaign is due to formally launch in July 2014.</p>\\n<h2>Second World War</h2>\\n\\n<p>During the Second World War, Victoria Park was largely closed to the public and effectively became one huge Ack-Ack (anti-aircraft) site. The gun emplacements conveniently straddled the path of German Luftwaffe bombers looping north west after attacking the docks and warehouses further south in what is now Tower Hamlets, and so the park was of some strategic importance.</p>\\n<p>More controversially, anti-aircraft activity in the park has been implicated in the crowd panic that caused the Bethnal Green tube disaster of 1943. Some eyewitness accounts have led to the suggestion that, after several air raid alerts, the panic run for shelter was caused by a gigantic explosion of noise from the direction of the park. A BBC documentary on the event suggests that this was due to the first firing of the new Z-Battery anti-aircraft rockets. The UK Ministry of Defence, however, disputes this account.</p>\\n<h2>Modern times</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1986 the Greater London Council transferred responsibility for the park to the London borough of Tower Hamlets and the London Borough of Hackney, through a joint management board. Since 1994 Tower Hamlets has run the park alone.</p>\\n<p>In recent times, Victoria Park became noted for its open-air music festivals, often linked with a political cause. The 1980 rock docudrama <i>Rude Boy</i> features The Clash playing at an Anti-Nazi League event in the park. Radiohead played two concerts in the park on 24\\u201325 June 2008. Madness celebrated their 30th year with a fifth Madstock there on 17 July 2009. The park has also become very popular amongst dance music's biggest names; Dutch DJ Ti\\u00ebsto played at Victoria Park in 2009 and again in 2010. On 24\\u201325 July 2010, Victoria Park was the site of the first High Voltage Festival. Victoria Park has also hosts Field Day, The Apple Cart, Underage Festival and Lovebox Festival.</p>\\n<p>For children, Victoria Park is host to: a <i>One O'Clock Club</i> for under-fives and a programme of summer activities and a children's play park including a paddling pool that runs from 1-5pm in the summer months.</p>\\n<p>The oldest model boat club in the world, the Victoria Model Steam Boat Club, founded in the Park on 15 July 1904, is still active today and holds up to 17 of their Sunday regattas a year. The VMSB Club runs straight-running boats just as they did 100 years ago but have also progressed to radio controlled boats and hydroplanes. The first Regatta is traditionally held on Easter Sunday and the Steam Regatta is always held on the first Sunday in July.</p>\\n<p>The Park is also the home of Tower Hamlets Football Club and Victoria Park United Football club, Victoria Park Harriers &amp; Tower Hamlets Athletics Club, which has its headquarters at St. Augustine's Hall located at the north-east corner of the Park. The Club celebrated its 80th Anniversary in 2006.</p>\\n<p>During the summer cricket is played every evening on the park's three all-weather wickets, organised by the Victoria Park Community Cricket League. The park also has a popular three-lane cricket net, free to use at all times. It was refurbished to a high standard at the end of 2005, paid for by a grant from the England and Wales Cricket Board.</p>\\n<p>The park is open daily from 6:00am to dusk.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2010 the National Lottery Big Lottery Fund awarded the London Borough of Tower Hamlets a \\u00a34.5\\u00a0million grant towards a \\u00a312\\u00a0million programme of major improvements to Victoria Park. Plans included a new building, the Eastern Hub, comprising a cafe, public toilets, community rooms and adult play facilities to promote healthy living.</p>\\n<p>The landscape has been restored in many places, and the Old English gardens restored to include new water features. In 1842 a pagoda was put in London's Hyde Park as an entrance to its Chinese Exhibit, and when the exhibit finished it was moved to Victoria Park's island in the west boating lake for ornamental purposes. The original architect for the park, Pennethorne, designed a bridge to the island that matched the style of the pagoda; this was never built, however, and during WW2 the pagoda suffered much damage.</p>\\n<p>The pagoda was eventually demolished in the 1950s and all but forgotten, while the water surrounding the island was filled in, shrinking the lake and making what was the island part of the park landscape. With the parks refurbishments that began in 2010 it was decided to restore the island to its former glory; the lake was extended back around the original area, the pagoda was replicated through the use of many photographs and eye-witness information and then, to complete Pennethorne's unfinished vision, the plans for his original bridge were discovered and the bridge built. It took over 100 years, but Pennethorne's vision was finally completed. As a finishing touch, pedallos and row boats were brought back on to the West lake, a feature which had been missing from the park for decades.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Burdett-Coutts fountain (named after Angela Burdett-Coutts the Victorian philanthropist) had a partial restoration of its intricate granite carvings and sculptures. In recent years the fountain had been fenced off due to graffiti and vandalism, but along with the restoration the fences were removed, and four symmetrical mirror pools were placed around the fountain along with decorative flower beds. The area is now a public space, with many benches offering an attractive place to sit.</p>\\n<p>A modern addition to the park is the Memoryscape trail, an audio trail winding through the park that visitors listen to using headphones. The trail consists of many historical facts and tidbits of information, and includes accounts from people who grew up in and around the park, with one person for example reminiscing about the prisoner of war camp in the park during World War 2. Visitors can either download the tracks from the council's website and put them on their own device, or they can get a pair of pre-loaded headphones from the hub in exchange for a small refundable deposit.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>London Buses Routes 277, 425 serve the heart of the park, 8, 399, D6, and Night Route N8 on Roman Road. 309 and D3 at London Chest Hospital via Approach Road. 388 (westbound) on Victoria Park Road.</p>\\n<p>Mile End tube station for the Central line, District line, Hammersmith &amp; City line services to Stratford, Upminster, Barking or Central London is 10min via Grove Road, you can take the 277 or 425 to Mile End which is 5min away. Cambridge Heath station for National Rail services to Liverpool Street and Enfield or Chingford is 5mins away via Bishops Way.</p>\\n<p>The Regent's Canal and Hertford Union Canal is located next to the park; this offers to access to walk or cycle on its towpaths. Mare Street or Mile End or Hackney Wick can easily be reached from here. The National Cycle Route 1 (NCR1) passes here on the Hertford Union Canal.</p>\\n<p>The Greenway walk/cycle path to Beckton via Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Newham General Hospital starts nearby at the far end of the park.</p>\\n<h2>Awards</h2>\\n<p>In summer 2008, the park was voted London's best local park by <i>Time Out</i> magazine. In 2011 it won its first Green Flag award (which it has won every year since,) and it was again voted London's favourite park, this time in the national People's Choice Award. In 2013/14 Victoria Park was also certified a Green Heritage Site by English Heritage and Keep Britain Tidy, an award given in recognition of achieving the required standard in the management and interpretation of a site with local or national historic importance, it retained this award in the following 2014/2015 year.</p>\\n<p>In 2013 the park came second in a national vote to find the public's favourite Green Flag Awarded park, beaten only by Margam Country Park in south Wales from a field of 1,448 qualifying open spaces.</p>\\n<p>In 2014 Victoria Park reinstated itself as the most popular park in the UK with over 13000 votes in the Green Flag Peoples Choice Awards.</p>\\n<h2>In popular culture</h2>\\n<ul><li>Appears in the feature film 'Pride.'

In 1719, <b>the Lower School</b> opened. It has moved many times and the school now has two separate buildings, one for Years 7 and 8, and one for Year 9 and above. From September 2010, due to BSF works the Lower School site will accommodate Years 7 to 8, with Years 9 to 13 remaining at the Upper School. The school has a low rate of A and A* grades at A Level.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Admissions</h2>\\n<p>It is situated in the north of Bethnal Green, just to the east of <i>Cambridge Heath Road</i> (A107) and half a mile south of the Regent's Canal and not far from the Cambridge Heath railway station. It is opposite the London Chest Hospital, just off the Old Ford Road (B118) and in the parish of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green. It is one of six schools in the borough that has a sixth form.</p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Henry Raine had made a good sum of money from selling alcohol. However he was a devout Christian, and he knew that he should use his wealth for good. He decided to found a school where poor children could get a free education. He built it in Wapping, where he lived and named it \\\"the Lower School\\\". It opened in 1719.</p>\\n<p>\\\"The Lower School\\\", was designed to provide an education for fifty boys and fifty girls between the ages of 8 and 18 years. They would learn \\\"the three Rs\\\", which were reading, writing and arithmetic. Girls however were also taught to sew and to cook, and boys were also made to shovel coal underground for the school's heating, and to scrub the floors. This was done in between periods.</p>\\n<h3>Boarding school</h3>\\n<p>In 1736 Henry built and set aside money for a boarding school which would take on forty girls from the Lower School. It was known as \\\"Raine's Hospital\\\" and later \\\"Asylum\\\"(this did not have the connotations it has today). It would have been quite pleasant, with clothes being provided along with frequent meals.</p>\\n<p>The boys and the girls were separated at first and the boys would be beaten if caught talking to a girl. Because of this a fence was put up between the boarding and lower school.</p>\\n<p>In 1820, a new boys' school was opened as there was a large increase in boys at the lower school which was only a boys' school, the girls had the boarding school but were soon to move to the Lower School. It was opened in Silver Street by the Duke of Clarence who was later King William IV.</p>\\n<p>In 1883, the boarding school closed and a new boys' and girls' school opened in Cannon Street Road. Not all places were free anymore, it was 3d a week for the preparatory school and 6d for the senior school.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Former site</h3>\\n<p>In 1913, the school moved to Arbour Square in Stepney, the building still stands today and is part of Tower Hamlets College. It was state of the art with its gymnasium, science laboratories, a girls' cookery room and in World War I a rifle range was built on the open rooftop for boys who could prepare for the army which they would fight in against the Germans. The separation for boys and girls continued until 1964, even the hall was separated by a hinged folding wooden dividing wall.</p>\\n<h3>Comprehensive</h3>\\n<p>In 1977, Raine's merged with St Jude's Secondary School and became a comprehensive school.</p>\\n<p>In 1985, the school moved to Old Bethnal Green Road (the lower school for years 7 and 8), and the old Parmiter's building in Approach Road. Both are in Bethnal Green and remain there until today. The Upper School site is being redeveloped from Summer 2010 as part of the Building Schools for the Future project. This will result in Year 9 being based in the Lower School building.</p>\\n<h2>Motto</h2>\\n<p>The motto was devised when the school opened. It was:</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>\\\"Come in and do your duty to God and man\\\".</i></dd>\\n</dl><p>It has, however, been changed to:</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>\\\"Come in and learn your duty to God and man\\\".</i></dd>\\n</dl><h2>Ethos and events</h2>\\n<p>The general ethos of the school has a friendly feel to it. The social integration of the pupils is good, as is their relationship with the teachers. Events include talent shows held regularly in the school at the end of terms. These are occasions when the pupils can show off talents or skills to their fellow pupils. The most recent was at Summer 2009.</p>\\n<h2>Uniform</h2>\\n<p>When it first opened it had a boys' uniform: cap, long coat with buttons (the neck button always had to be done up), tights and high heel-like shoes.

At some point in 2008 it is proposed that lower and upper schools will temporarily be merged in order to allow building work to take place at the lower school site with the current building being demolished. Due to its age, the upper school buildings shall remain but the interiors will receive refurbishment. The old Headteacher, Gordon Clubb, moved from temporary Head to a permanent position in 2007-2013.</p>\\n<h2>Academic performance</h2>\\n<p>It gets GCSE and A level results slightly under the England average.

The youngest classes follow a Montessori-style education, but the influence of the national curriculum has brought the older classes more into line with mainstream schools. The school admits children from the full ability range, with an emphasis on the Arts, including visits to museums and theatres, as well as sports and outward bound activities.</p>\\n<p>The School was originally founded in Smithfield, London by Phyllis Wallbank, in 1948. It was originally housed in the Gatehouse of St Bartholomew-the-Great church in Smithfield but moved to Bethnal Green in the 1970s. It has been run along Montessori method principles developed by the educationalist Maria Montessori and initially served children from 2 \\u2013 16 years of age, and at the time of its founding, was quite untraditional in its educational philosophy. The school's 60th anniversary in 2008 was marked by a service in the school's original home, St Bartholomew's in Smithfield.</p>\\n<p>The School integrates children with a wide range of disabilities with able-bodied children. It follows the idea that true learning resulted from children exploring the world for themselves through play. It allows children to choose when to take their lessons during the week. A child is required to complete a certain number of lessons in Mathematics, English, Art, Geography etc. per week but would be able to decide when to do them. Students also have free lessons where they can choose any subject they like. The balance of subjects are often weighted towards a child's aptitude or current interests. Different abilities/ages of children are taught in the same session, and their teachers 'sign pupils off' for the lessons they have completed. Some older children (14/15 year olds) can then take the amount of each subject they wished to do over the course of each week, resulting in some pupils spending the week doing 'what they want' e.g., Art/Monday, Geography/Tuesday, English/Wednesday, Biology/Thursday and then back to Art/Friday.</p>\\n<p>After an hour for lunch pupils have an hour to read followed by 'afternoon activities'. These include football, swimming, and visits to museums. The school has also had two ponies, as well as a duck, for the children. It also has an old farm cottage just outside Clochan in Scotland.</p>\\n<p>The Gatehouse School featured in several documentary programmes during the 1970s. Saxophonist &amp; Bon Viveur Brian Hardy taught Art &amp; Dance here. Actors Sophie Ward and Linus Roche were pupils.</p>\\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\\n<ul><li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Vocation of Teaching.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Moral Teaching through Shakespeare's Tragedies.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Way we Learn.\\\" <i>The Sower: A Quarterly Magazine on Christian Formation</i>.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"The Philosophy of International Education.\\\" <i>Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education</i> 12/2 (2001) 193-209.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Periods of Sensitivity within Human Lives.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 12/3 (2001) 337-384.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Savants.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 13/1 (2002) 137-140.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Time.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 14/1 (2003) 1-12.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Montessori and the New Century.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 14/2 (2003) 135-144.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"A Universal Way of Education.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 15/3 (2004) 521-532.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Adolescence.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 18/1 (2007) 77-90.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Dr Maria Montessori: The Past, the Present and the Future.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 18/2 (2007) 149-158.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"A Montessori Journey: Phyllis Wallbank celebrates the life and work of Dr Montessori.\\\" Montessori International Magazine 83 (2007) 32-33.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"Imagination.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/1 (2009) 107-108.</li>\\n<li>Wallbank, Phyllis. \\\"War and Time.\\\" Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education 20/2 (2009) 255-258.</li>\\n<li>Coelho, Ivo.

The union with Hackney was very unpopular with the inhabitants of Stoke Newington, and following unsuccessful attempts to end it in 1864, 1880 and 1890, the parish regained independence in 1894. Stoke Newington Vestry consisted of 60 vestrymen, elected from five wards.</p>\\n<p>South Hornsey formed the southern part of the parish of Hornsey, consisting of the Brownswood Park area south of Finsbury Park, 29 acres (0.1\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of Clissold Park and two detached areas entirely surrounded by the parish of Stoke Newington. The exclaves of South Hornsey effectively cut off the south-eastern section of Stoke Newington from the rest of the parish. A local board was formed to govern the area in 1867, becoming an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894.</p>\\n<h3>Formation</h3>\\n<p>The London Government Act 1899 provided that the County of London should be divided into metropolitan boroughs. The new authorities were to based on existing parishes with simplified boundaries. It was intended that each borough would have a population of between 100,000 and 400,000 inhabitants. Where an area fell below the threshold of 100,000 inhabitants, it might still be constituted a borough if it had a rateable value exceeding 500,000 pounds.</p>\\n<p>Stoke Newington presented a problem, as its population fell well below the prescribed limits. It was recognised that there were three possibilities: to recombine the parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington into a single borough; to divide the existing parish of Hackney and combine the wealthier northern section with Stoke Newington to form a municipality with the boundaries of the Hackney North parliamentary constituency; or to add neighbouring areas of Middlesex to increase the population. The first two options were rejected as it was recognised that there was <i>\\\"great ill-feeling and mutual ill-will... between the inhabitants of the two districts\\\"</i>, and it was decided to merge the bulk of South Hornsey, with a population about 20,000, with Stoke Newington. While this still created a borough of only about 50,000 inhabitants, and thus <i>\\\"the smallest borough in London, the anomaly would be a gradually diminishing one, because the population in this district was rapidly increasing. When dividing London up into boroughs they could not avoid creating some anomalies as to size.\\\"</i></p>\\n<h3>Boundaries</h3>\\n<p>Under the 1899 legislation, boundary commissioners were appointed to set the boundaries of the new boroughs. The existing parish boundaries frequently divided houses or related to field boundaries that had disappeared with the urbanisation of the area. The commissioners realigned the boundary lines so that for the most part they ran down the centre of roads, railways or watercourses.</p>\\n<p>To the north, the borough had a boundary with Middlesex, marked by the course of the New River and the Seven Sisters Road. Stoke Newington's boundaries with the two neighbouring metropolitan boroughs within the County of London were as follows:</p>\\n<ul><li>Islington to the west and south: the centres of Blackstock Road, Mountgrove Roads, Green Lanes, (diverting to take in Petherton Road and Leconfield Road) Matthias Road and Boleyn Road.</li>\\n<li>Hackney to the east and north east: the centre of the ancient Ermine Street, known here as Kingsland High Street, Stoke Newington Road and Stoke Newington High Street, then following the North London Railway from Stoke Newington railway station to Bethune Road. (The area to the east of the main road, including Stoke Newington Common, never formed part of Stoke Newington administratively, lying within the parish of Hackney).</li>\\n</ul><h2>Coat of arms</h2>\\n\\n<p>The long association with the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral is represented by the red background and crossed swords. The cross is from the arms of William Patten, first lord of the manor and rebuilder of the church of St Mary, in 1550. The trees represent the ancient forest, and the green lion, that of John Dudley. The griffin refers to Daniel Defoe, and the banner, the arms of Sir Thomas Abney.</p>\\n<p>The Latin motto translates as <i>Look to the past and the future</i>, the arms were granted on 12 June 1934.</p>\\n<p>When merged to found the London Borough of Hackney in 1965, oaks from these arms were put in the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>The coat of arms of 1934 replaced an unofficial device adopted by the council on incorporation in 1900. At the top of the shield was a representation of the parish church. The lower part of the shield featured the arms of the cities of London and Westminster on the left, and the attributed arms of the Kingdom of Essex representing Middlesex on the right. These armorial devices were chosen to represent the union of Stoke Newington in the County of London and South Hornsey in Middlesex. The crest was formed by a tree, recalling Stoke Newington's origin as a village in the Middlesex Forest.<br clear=\\\"all\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Area and population</h2>\\n<h3>Predecessor authorities</h3>\\n<p>Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 show the population growth in London, over the preceding century. The figures compiled by the council for 1891 do not agree with those that appear in the census reports, however which gave a population of 47,988 for the area.</p>\\n<p><b>Stoke Newington St Mary's with South Hornsey 1801-1900</b></p>\\n<h3>Metropolitan borough</h3>\\n<p>The area of the parish of Stoke Newington was 639 acres (2.6\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) in 1891. Following the addition of most of South Hornsey and the boundary adjustments with Hackney and Islington, the area of the borough in 1901 was 863 acres (3.5\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). The populations recorded in National Censuses were:</p>\\n<p><b>Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961</b></p>\\n<h2>Politics</h2>\\n\\n<h3>Borough council</h3>\\n<p>The borough council consisted of 30 councillors and 5 aldermen. In 1900 the boundary commissioners divided the borough into six wards for the election of councillors:<br></p>\\n<p>The first council elected consisted entirely of \\\"Non-Party\\\" candidates, although <i>The Times</i> noted that they were \\\"Conservative in character\\\". The entire council continued to be described as Independent or Non-Party until the 1934 election when the Labour Party gained 13 seats to the Independents' 17. Labour gained control of the council in 1945, taking all of the seats on the council. The Conservative Party first ran in the 1949 election, winning control from Labour by 23 seats to 7.</p>\\n<p>The wards of the borough were redrawn in 1953, with the area divided into ten wards, each electing three councillors. This reflected the change in settlement in the area, in particular the construction of new estates of council flats, including the London County Council's large Woodberry Down development which housed about a seventh of the borough's population. The names of the wards, a number of which were named after famous residents of Stoke Newington, were as follows:</p>\\n<p>Labour regained power at the 1953 election with 24 seats to 6 Conservatives. They held control at subsequent elections, taking all the seats in 1959. The final election of the council on 10 May 1962 saw four Liberal Party councillors elected to form an opposition group to the 26 Labour members.</p>\\n<h3>Parliamentary constituency</h3>\\n<p>Until 1918 the area formed part of the constituency of Hackney North. In 1918 a new constituency of Stoke Newington identical with the metropolitan borough was created. Due to loss of population, the two constituencies were merged in 1950 as Hackney North and Stoke Newington.</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>London Government Act 1899</li>\\n<li>Metropolis Management Act 1855</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n\\n<h2><cite>Further reading</cite></h2>\\n<ul><li><cite>Robert Donald, ed.

You could just squeeze three people into the control booth! The tape deck was a Brenell 1\\u00a0inch 8 track. The monitors and desk were custom made, and they had a pair of Auratones as well, fed from Quad power amps. The desk was quite small, pushed hard against the front wall with the custom monitors hung above and the Auratones on the meter bridge.

A total of 196,843 burials had taken place there as of the year 2000. It is a Local Nature Reserve.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Location</h2>\\n<p>The official address of Abney Park is Stoke Newington High Street, N16. The main gate is at the junction of this street and Rectory Road, with a smaller gate on Stoke Newington Church Street. The park lies within the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<h2>Past and present</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 1840, Abney Park opened as a model garden cemetery, a pioneering non-denominational place of rest. Its approach was based on the Congregational church's role in the London Missionary Society (LMS), whose fundamental principle was to develop a wholly non-denominational exemplar. It also drew on American burial ideas, specifically Mount Auburn in Massachusetts. Details of the Abney Park Cemetery Company can be found in the diaries of William Copeland Astbury (volumes covering 1831\\u201348)</p>\\n<p>At first there were many links between Abney Park Cemetery and the LMS but this nonconformist (and in particular Congregationalist) period came to a close in the early 1880s when a strictly commercial general cemetery company was formed and the land at Abney Park was made over to the new enterprise. Though the park had not been formalised in 1840 as a cemetery through Act of Parliament or consecration, and Church faculty law never applied, burial ground use, had, by the 1880s, already come to predominate over the wider landscape, access and educational objects of its founders.</p>\\n<p>The founders' financial and legal structure, adapted from the model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, but this was not evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model and the way in which plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.</p>\\n<p>Eventually sold on the open market to a wholly commercially-minded general cemetery company in the 1880s, established with a similar name, three new cemeteries were founded in London's suburbs or nearby countryside. From then onwards standardised park-like landscaping principles came to be applied at Abney Park, replacing much of the unique arboretum planting. Air pollution also took its toll, affecting the conifer walks. After the First World War, path infill began to be practised; a situation that became severe in the 1950s and was continued into the 1970s, when the commercial cemetery company went into liquidation.</p>\\n<p>In 1978, apart from one forecourt building, the park passed to the local council as a burial ground and open space subject to the Local Authorities Cemeteries Order of 1977. For the next twenty-one years, there being only a small number of residual burial and monuments rights, the Council worked with local groups and relatives to accommodate these rights, and exercise discretion to allow occasional courtesy burials, where families had previously held deeds from the cemetery company; but by and large nature was allowed to take its course.</p>\\n<p>Abney Park was included on the Heritage at Risk Register in 2009, as one of Britain's historic parks and gardens at risk from neglect and decay. Although the level of malicious damage is kept low by the conspicuous presence of staff and volunteers of the Abney Park Trust when maintaining the park; by frequent arts and environmental events promoted by the Trust; and by community safety initiatives involving the police and their community support officers; nevertheless, over time it has taken its toll, leading to the current 'at risk' designation. The roof slates and roof flashings of the Abney Park Chapel have been damaged by unauthorised climbing and theft at times when the park was left unsupervised and unlocked overnight, and this has resulted in water seepage into the chapel walls which is now causing serious problems to the whole building. Similarly, from time to time, some sections of boundary wall become too weak due to people climbing over them, and decay has set in. However these matters could be put right and the park is a popular place to visit, with a range of educational, training and cultural events and an annual summer open day. It is a designated Local Nature Reserve and Conservation Area. Apart from the South Lodge extension on the forecourt, Abney Park's freehold is owned by the London Borough of Hackney. The park is situated near Stoke Newington High Street, London N16, and it is leased to the Abney Park Trust. It occupies 12.53 hectares (31.0 acres), which includes a nature reserve, a classroom, a visitor's centre and a central chapel which is disused. The park is normally opened by the Trust for free public access on weekdays and weekends from about 9.30 am to 5 pm, and for access or events agreed with the Trust at all other times.</p>\\n<h2>The Egyptian Revival entrance</h2>\\n<p>One of the \\\"Magnificent Seven\\\" parkland cemeteries created in the early Victorian period, albeit set out in an entirely different way to the others and with somewhat wider purposes, Abney Park features an entrance designed by William Hosking FSA in collaboration with Joseph Bonomi the Younger and the cemetery's founder George Collison II. This frontage was built by John Jay in the then increasingly popular Egyptian Revival style, with hieroglyphics signifying the \\\"Abode of the Mortal Part of Man\\\": a venture too far into the architecture of the African continent for Augustus Pugin, who pilloried the idea, hoping no-one would repeat such a radical departure from \\\"good\\\" Christian gothic design (see illustration for <i>Grounds of a Quaker School</i>). A similar criticism had previously been made when the first Egyptian-style entrance to a western cemetery had been constructed at Mount Auburn Cemetery in the 1830s, on which Abney Park Cemetery was partially modelled. By contrast, figures who appreciated the composition complimented Hosking and Bonomi on their scholarly frontage design; an arbiter of design taste, John Loudon, described it as a \\\"judicious combination of two lodges with gates between\\\".</p>\\n<p>Abney Park has a claim to be the earliest complete design for a permanent \\\"Egyptian Revival\\\" entranceway at a cemetery anywhere in the world. The gateway at Mount Auburn Cemetery, from which it took its inspiration, was at that time still a temporary structure, being made of dusted wood and sand; its permanent design was not built until two years after Abney Park opened. In England there were already some examples of the use of Egyptian Revival architecture on a small scale, including one example of a small gate installed at a cemetery for Nonconformists near Sheffield in 1836. However, Abney Park Cemetery became the first to employ the style for cemetery buildings, and also the first to introduce it for a complete entrance design.</p>\\n\\n<p>At Abney Park the use of motifs not associated with contemporary faith served a profound purpose, since it was consciously opened as the first wholly nondenominational garden cemetery in Europe. True, other garden cemeteries sometimes used the term loosely, meaning only that they had laid out more than one denominational area or built more than one chapel. Abney Park Cemetery was the first to be laid out with \\\"no invidious dividing lines\\\" separating the burial areas of one faith or religious group from any other, and even its one chapel, the Abney Park Chapel, a feast of <i>Puritan</i> or northern European brick gothic yet with ample stone dressings and a little neoclassical design woven into its early Dissenting Gothic design style, had but one central chamber for the common use of all, and but one entrance. As such it was the first nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. William Hosking, in being handed the task of achieving this vision, became the first architect to design a nondenominational cemetery chapel in Europe. Underpinning this was a unique legal basis in comparison with the other garden cemeteries of its period; Abney Park was not set aside solely for cemetery use by Act of Parliament, and was not formally consecrated as burial land. Perhaps more so than any other it was entitled to be considered as a park as well as a cemetery.</p>\\n<p>Today it is accommodating this wide role again; burial rights ceased when the private company closed in 1978, enabling the park to now facilitate a wide range of projects in the arts, education, nature conservation and walking/recreation, besides offering new memorial trees and benches where ashes are scattered, and the occasional discretionary or courtesy burial.</p>\\n<h2>Landscape</h2>\\n\\n<p>Abney Park was unique in being the first arboretum to be combined with a cemetery in Europe; offering an educational attraction that was originally set in a landscape of fields and woods, some distance from the built-up boundary of London. Its 2,500 trees and shrubs were all labelled, and arranged around the perimeter alphabetically, from A for <i>Acer</i> (maple trees) to Z for <i>Zanthoxylum</i> (American toothache trees).</p>\\n<p>The emphasis on an educational landscape, as opposed to a purely aesthetic, visually attractive picturesque, drew partly on a simplified version of John Loudon's 'Gardenesque' concept, and applied something akin to this, but with a unique alphabetical approach, and no structural mounding, to a picturesque cemetery design. It was much admired by John Loudon, who described Abney Park Cemetery as \\\"the most highly ornamented cemetery in the vicinity of London\\\", albeit that he favoured a more formal and classical approach to garden cemetery design as a general rule and, in 1843 developed design principles for such an approach.</p>\\n<p>At the Stoke Newington cemetery the botanical planting was carefully sited since the design sought to do as little as possible to change the existing picturesque parkland. This careful approach drew on that used at Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston where Dearborn had emphasised the compatibility of horticulture and even an experimental garden with a cemetery, leading to the opening of a cemetery supported by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society; one that succeeded in establishing a picturesque landscape coupled with botanical garden specimens and an adjoining scientific garden. There were important differences, however; the New England cemetery had benefited from a more sylvan setting than that of Abney Park, and a much larger estate. Nonetheless, the ties were evident. The founding directors of the Abney Park project were all Congregationalists, who together with other nonconformists had strong links with their brethren in the new world, to where they had emigrated in search of religious freedom. George Collison, Abney Park Cemetery's company secretary, and the key force behind its radical design, recorded his visit to, and impressions of, Mount Auburn Cemetery, in a book published to coincide with the opening of the Stoke Newington cemetery. It also contains a complete list of all the arboretum species and varieties planted at Abney Park.</p>\\n<p>The concept of the arboretum -and indeed also a rosarium \\u2013 was inspired by George Loddiges FLS FZS, a local Hackney nurseryman who became a small shareholder in the cemetery company and was appointed to lead its landscape design, planting and educational labelling, to complement William Hosking's layout and building and engineering (drainage) scheme. The pair worked closely as a design team under the guiding influence of the third designer George Collison, who represented the client company both as its solicitor and principal learned visionary. Loddiges' earlier experience in designing an A to Z arboretum at his Mare Street nursery, and possession of one of the largest ranges of trees and shrubs then grown for sale in Britain, ensured success.</p>\\n<p>The overall effect was to establish Abney Park as the most impressively landscaped garden cemetery of its period. However regrettably, Loddiges Nursery closed in the early 1850s and thereafter maintenance of the trees and shrubs and of their botanical labels, was impaired. Today Loddiges' work is of unparalleled significance to landscape design, being recognised as of European importance. Abney Park was the first London cemetery to be invited to join the Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe (ASCE) and it is the only surviving example of an English landscape designed by George Loddiges FLS FZS.</p>\\n<h2>The <i>Campo Santo</i> of the Dissenters</h2>\\n\\n<p>Such an elaborate planting scheme for a park cemetery may also be a reflection of the symbolic importance the founding directors attached to the land that formed Abney Park Cemetery. As nonconformists, who treasured the independence of their religious beliefs\\u2014and therefore practised Christianity outside of the established Church of England\\u2014they held the land <i>itself</i> to be of immense significance, for it had previously been two neighbouring and inter-related 18th-century parkland estates, the grounds of Abney House and Fleetwood House, where the non-conformist Doctor of Divinity, educationalist and poet Dr. Isaac Watts lived and taught, and indeed wrote several of his popular books and hymns.</p>\\n<p>Due to these religious associations, Abney Park Cemetery rapidly became the most attractive Victorian resting place for nonconformist or dissenting ministers and educationalists, principally those from a Protestant dissenting tradition. Indeed it stands today as the most important burial place in the UK of 19th-century Congregational, Baptist, Methodist and Salvation Army ministers and educationalists, including Christopher Newman Hall and many others, some of whom are mentioned below. Whereas Bunhill Fields was described by the poet Robert Southey as \\\"the <i>Campo Santo</i> of the Dissenters\\\" (a reference to the monumental cemetery of that name in Pisa, Italy \\u2013 <i>campo santo</i> translates as \\\"sacred field\\\" or \\\"saints' abode\\\" ) in respect of its late 17th- and 18th-century burials, Abney Park took on the mantle during the Victorian period in the writings of E. Paxton Hood for the Religious Tract Society.</p>\\n<p>Though it primarily attracted Congregational, Methodist and Salvation Army nonconformists, rather than certain other nonconformists such as Quakers, or non-Protestant nonconformists such as Catholics or Jewish people, Abney Park Cemetery more than any other 19th-century cemetery was open to the burial of all regardless of their religious convictions or leanings. Whilst its founding directors were all Congregationalists and they were concerned to find a place for such burials, they expressly established the Stoke Newington cemetery as the first fully nondenominational cemetery in Europe (where anyone could be buried anywhere). Selection of a site with historical associations with Dr Isaac Watts served this purpose well, for he had been honoured in death with a bust in the Anglican Westminster Abbey to complement his burial at the Independent's Bunhill Fields. Subsequently his hymns and scholarly works had become widely used and referred to by many denominations, such that in the 19th century the Rev. John Stroughton could write: \\\"Dr. Watts was as far removed from sectarianism as a man could be\\\". Abney Park Chapel, sometimes referred to informally as Dr Watts' Chapel, became its spiritual and landscape focal point. It sits in the heart of the cemetery; its axial walk to Church Street, called Dr Watts' Walk, was chosen in 1845 as the most appropriate site in London for a public statue to the great man, sculpted by Edward Hodges Baily, RA FRS.</p>\\n<h2>Educational establishments</h2>\\n<p>Besides its religious associations, Abney Park has a strong educational pedigree. For example, its prominent director in the mid-to-late Victorian era, Charles Reed, was also the Chairman of the London School Board and Hackney's first MP. In fact, this part of north London, particularly Newington Green, had a long history of innovative education for boys and young men, known as dissenting academies.</p>\\n<p>Abney House was the first premises in England to be used exclusively as a Wesleyan training college, from c. 1838. This followed use of temporary, shared facilities in Hackney, and prior to the building of their own spacious colleges and grounds, one in the north of England, and a second at Richmond Hill, to which the college at Abney Park moved in 1843. Abney House was then demolished. The governorship of the seminary was held by Rev. John Farrar, Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its elected President.</p>\\n<p>Next to Abney House on Church Street was Fleetwood House, used as the base for Newington Academy for Girls, which was founded in 1824 by, among others, the Quaker scientist and abolitionist William Allen and run in a most enlightened and imaginative way by Susanna Corder, who later emigrated for a while to Boston and emerged as a talented biographer. It lost exclusive use of attractive grounds in the eastern part of Abney Park on formation of the cemetery, leaving only the school house and a small garden for the private use of the students. However, they were welcome to use the new cemetery's educational arboretum and this, along with Abney Park as a whole, was rarely shared with many others in the early years of the new cemetery, except at weekends. The school's innovative approach included transport arrangements; it commissioned the first school bus in the world.</p>\\n<h2>Famous people: burials and associations in the park</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most notably, William and Catherine Booth, founders of The Salvation Army, are buried in a prominent location close to Church Street and next to their son Bramwell Booth and various SA commissioners, including Elijah Cadman, John Lawley, William Ridsdel, Frederick Booth-Tucker, George Scott Railton, the Army's first Commissioner, Theodore Kitching and T. Henry Howard, its Chief of Staff.</p>\\n<p>Earlier in the 19th century, one of the hottest issues for political and social reform was the abolition of slavery, and Stoke Newington and the Quakers, separately and together, played a prominent role in this. Indeed, William Wilberforce himself planned to be buried in the village at St Mary's Church with his sister, his will being overturned on his death since parliament considered a state funeral at Westminster Abbey more fitting. Wilberforce's son-in-law, the abolitionist lawyer James Stephen, was also a frequent visitor, as his father lived at the Fleetwood Summerhouse adjacent to Abney Park. Dr Thomas Binney, the \\\"Archbishop of Non-conformity\\\", has a portrait in the National Portrait Gallery that shows him at the Anti-Slavery Society Convention (with Josiah Conder); Binney is buried close to the Church Street entrance in Abney Park Cemetery. Christopher Newman Hall, who was influential on the side of slavery emancipation in the American Civil War, is buried here with his father. So is the Rev. James Sherman, who wrote the introduction to Harriet Beecher Stowe's hugely influential <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. The novel was partly based on Josiah Henson, whose escape to freedom in Britain was assisted by the philanthropist Samuel Morley, who is buried in the cemetery. The Rev. Joseph Ketley, a Congregational missionary and abolitionist in Demerara, is also interred here, as is Rev. Dr John Morison, patron of the escaped slave and influential African-American autobiographer Moses Roper.</p>\\n\\n<p>Recently rediscovered is the grave of Olaudah Equiano's daughter Joanna Vassa, as he was a well-known former slave who worked for abolition. Jamaican emancipation is represented directly by the Rev. Samuel Oughton and the Rev. Thomas Burchell, who only narrowly escaped death at the hands of the planters; and their underlying Baptist support by Nathaniel Rogers M.D. A deacon at the Burchell Baptist church, the African Samuel Sharpe, became a Jamaican hero. Aaron Buzacott, the second Secretary of Anti-Slavery International, originally known as the Anti-Slavery Society, is buried here. At Abney Park Cemetery there are also some of the early settlers in Britain from the four corners of the world, such as the African, Thomas Caulker, the son of the King of Bompey (now Sierra Leone), who signed an anti-slavery agreement that became part of an Act of Parliament in the 1850s; and Leota, a native of the Samoa Islands whose life in London was due to the work of the London Missionary Society who sought to build schools and bring scripture to the inhabitants of the South Seas. Abney Park is one of the main burial places of 19th-century missionaries; here, for example is the burial place of William Ellis, John Williams' wife and son, Dr Walter Henry Medhurst, and Edward Stallybrass. Also Sarah Buzacott, the wife of Aaron Buzacott the elder, who was a teacher at the London Missionary Society college at Rarotonga in the South Seas. Many nonconformist divines are also buried here, for example Dr Alexander Fletcher, 'The Children's Friend'.</p>\\n<p>The evangelist Emily Gosse is buried in a simple grave near Dr Watts' Mound. Close to Church Street is the burial of one of the cemetery's early Director and Trustees, one of the first two members of parliament for Hackney Sir Charles Reed FSA. Close by lies his father Dr Andrew Reed (1788\\u20131862), a student of Rev. George Collison and founder of the London Orphan Asylum. In 1834, along with the Rev. J. Matheson, Andrew Reed was sent to the Congregational Churches of America by the Congregational Union of England and Wales as a deputation to promote peace and friendship between the two communities. He spent six months in America and during his stay there Yale University conferred upon him an honorary Doctorate of Divinity. This strengthened the Congregationalists' transatlantic links, ensuring the Rev George Collison's son a welcome when he visited to gain ideas for Abney Park cemetery's design from Mount Auburn Cemetery.</p>\\n<p>Here too is the Welsh MP Henry Richard, a mid-19th-century secretary of the Peace Society, instrumental in encouraging the first university in Wales at Aberystwyth along with its founder Sir Hugh Owen, whose own memorial is to the east of the Abney Park Cedar Circle. Also buried here is Betsi Cadwaladr, a Welsh nurse who worked in the Crimea with Florence Nightingale. The Peace Society is well represented at Abney Park; two of its other 19th-century secretaries, Rev. Nun Morgan Harry and Rev. John Jefferson are also buried here. Rajendra Chandra Chandra, Professor of Calcutta Medical College and physician, is also buried here with his wife.</p>\\n<p>Pioneering fire fighter James Braidwood, credited with forming the first municipal fire brigade; Edward Calvert, painter; engraver and painter and novelist Isabella Banks; newspaper editor and playwright George Linnaeus Banks; and the African-Jamaican Baptist missionary Rev. Joseph Jackson Fuller, are also buried in the Park. So too are Rev William Brock D.D., John Hoppus D.D. of University College London, and John Harris D.D. and Robert Halley of New College London.</p>\\n<p>Amongst the theatre and music hall performers resting at Abney Park are George Leybourne, Nelly Power, Albert Chevalier, G. W. Hunt, Herbert Campbell, Edmund Payne, Dan Crawley, Walter Laburnum and Fred Albert. These graves are cared for by the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America who undertake memorial restorations and provide free monthly guided walks. </p>\\n<p>Other burials at the cemetery include the Chartist leader and publisher James \\\"Bronterre\\\" O'Brien, whose life and work is celebrated at the cemetery each year, especially by the Irish community and those in the Labour Movement; Dr John Pye Smith, the first dissenter to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; Mary Hays, the feminist writer and friend of Mary Wollstonecraft; Eric Walrond, the African-American Harlem Renaissance writer; and Thomas William Robertson the dramatic author. John O'Connor Power (1846\\u20131919), Irish Member of Parliament for Mayo, orator, barrister, radical journalist and author of <i>The Making of an Orator</i> is buried here with his wife's family. A Victoria Cross recipient from the Indian Mutiny, Private John Freeman, is buried here. World record holder in motor-paced cycling Tommy Hall.</p>\\n<p>In a different way, Susanna Bostock is remembered, largely due to the dominance of her life-sized marble lion alongside a path close to the chapel. Along with the Wombwells, the Bostocks were mainly responsible for bringing Asian and African animals to the attention of the Victorian public. For part of the year giraffes lived close to the cemetery at a small farm in Yoakley Road.</p>\\n<h2>First &amp; Second World Wars</h2>\\n\\n<p>Abney Park contains war graves to 371 Commonwealth service personnel who died in the two World Wars and which are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission: 258 from World War I and 113 from World War II. Unusually, Stoke Newington has two \\\"Cross of Sacrifice\\\" monuments constructed shortly after the end of WWI based on Blomfield's famous design: one on the lawn in front of St. Mary's Church on Church Street, and one in front of the south-facing facade of Abney Park Chapel in the cemetery. The names associated with the first cross are displayed a short distance away (inside the foyer of the public library on Church Street) whilst the names of those associated with the second cross (those who are interred in the cemetery but whose graves could not be given individual headstones) are recorded on a north-facing Screen Wall memorial added to the platform on which it stands. Near the cemetery cross, the names of Second World War servicemen who lost their lives and have been buried in the cemetery without separate commemoration, have also been displayed.</p>\\n<p>The cemetery's 'Cross of Sacrifice' serves as a landmark, but though rising on a ragstone platform of contrasting Portland Stone, it cannot be viewed on the approach from Church Street since the cemetery company chose to infill Dr Watts' axial walk at the time the war memorial was erected, so they designed the platform screen wall to prevent the cross from being seen from the south. The Trust hopes to change this if a redesign can be agreed, so as to display the cross to be seen from more directions and as a vantage point and focal point overlooking both directions of the original axis from the chapel spire and its ogee arch along Dr Watts' Walk, and on to Abney House gate; the axis that commemorates the life of the Rev. Dr Isaac Watts. Slightly off this exact axial alignment, is the small Blitz memorial that records civilian deaths, closer to the south entrance (picture right).</p>\\n<p>Though it suffered extensive property damage in the war, Stoke Newington's death toll was relatively low by the standards of some other Hackney districts like Shoreditch, and it would have been lower still, were it not for one incident on 13 October 1940, when a German bomb made a direct hit on a crowded shelter at Coronation Avenue, just off the high street. Most people in the shelter were killed, and as the illustration shows, the list of the dead from this one incident takes up nearly three of the four panels on the memorial. Many of the dead were Jewish and some were refugees from the Nazis.</p>\\n<p>Of two known unexploded WWII bombs remaining in Stoke Newington, one is located somewhere in Abney Park.</p>\\n<h2>'Sweet Auburn' &amp; woodland wildlife</h2>\\n<p>As may have been implied already, Abney Park Cemetery was the only garden cemetery of its era to be influenced by New World cemetery design ideas due to the strong links between its founders and New England; in particular Boston. The Stoke Newington cemetery reflects the design style adopted for Mount Auburn, for example in its use of an Egyptian Revival entrance and arboretum. However, though its \\\"model\\\" lay in the New World, it drew on different romantic landscape associations. Whereas Mount Auburn Cemetery celebrated the 'Sweet Auburn' of poetry, in particular the nature and woodland associated with the Auburn village area, it was the \\\"romance\\\" of religious and historical associations that primarily attracted the founders of London's first nondenominational garden cemetery, to Lady Mary Abney's estate which had served as an inspiration to the celebrated Isaac Watts. Nonetheless, on its opening, Abney Park was by far the most sylvan of all garden cemeteries in Britain; its many stately trees imbued the landscape with a uniquely well-timbered inheritance or \\\"green cloak\\\", and plans were put in train to encourage this further with collections of trees arranged along, and set back from, path edges. Whereas the cemetery at Mount Auburn had been blessed with a natural woodland setting, well suited to its founders' ethos of creating an Elysian paradise, Abney Park would take some time to more closely reflect its predominantly woodland style of cemetery design and a more transcendental view of nature as proposed by Emerson, and Thoreau in New England.</p>\\n\\n<p>Slowly, however, time has healed this difference and the landscape at Abney Park has grown closer to its New World cousin. Mature trees and woodland now adorn Abney Park, completing its transformation into a woodland cemetery. This has been so profound a change that by the early 1990s the cemetery was acknowledged to be the largest woodland ecosystem in North London so close to the centre of the City of London, and became designated as the first statutory Local Nature Reserve in the London Borough of Hackney.</p>\\n<p>Under careful management the woodland is slowly becoming enriched through natural regeneration. The northern areas are slowly returning to native oaks with a hornbeam and hawthorn understory, and a woodland ground flora that includes Wood False Brome grass and Wood Spurge; the whole being interspersed with naturalising exotic thorns and service trees to add a cross-cultural dimension. Meanwhile, the sandy brickearth soils that extend from Church Street along Dr Watts' Walk to the chapel lawns, the sole surviving heathland in Hackney, are returning to a lighter structure based on Silver Birch woodland and healthy species such as bracken fern. Today, a range of woodland birds, mammals and butterflies are supported; the grounds forming one of north London's largest breeding sites so close to the City for some very attractive species such as the Speckled Wood butterfly.</p>\\n<p>Nature changes gradually however, and the ecology will need active habitat management if these semi-natural sylvan qualities are to be preserved and enhanced, and to ensure that the naturalising exotic arboretum trees (such as Various-leaved Hawthorn and Service Tree of Fontainebleau) and plans for the replacement of Loddiges' perimeter A to Z arboretum, contribute their valuable educational and botanical interest to parts of the grounds.</p>\\n<h2>Endpiece</h2>\\n<p>Part of a Victorian account of a visit to admire the beauties of Abney Park Cemetery reads:</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<p>There is a beautiful cemetery in Stoke Newington, and it was given to the inhabitants in memory of Lady Abney, who was a sincere friend to Dr. Watts. There is in it a pretty little church, where funeral services are performed by all denominations of Christians.</p>\\n<p>Lady Abney was very liberal in her religious views, and the cemetery is, with its church, open to all alike, and though its grounds were never consecrated, yet many rigid churchmen have been buried in it. There is no quieter burial spot within a dozen miles of London in any direction, and there are cedars of Lebanon in it, wide lawns, and beautiful flowers.</p>\\n<p>There is an old clergyman in the church, who is always ready to officiate for a small fee on funeral occasions. He is over eighty years old, his hair is like the snow, and he is a fit companion to such a solemn place.</p>\\n<p>One shining evening, with a female friend we visited the cemetery, and stopped in the little [largely] Gothic chapel to talk with the venerable clergyman. The tears actually sprung over his eyelids when we said that we came from America.</p>\\n<p>The old man asked a thousand questions about the wonderful far land of liberty in the west, which we were glad to answer. Almost every family among the poor respectable classes in England, has some member, or relation in America.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Gallery</h2>\\n<p>Abney Park Cemetery is one of the Magnificent Seven.

It is a 13ha (32 acre) park dating from just before 1700, named after Lady Mary Abney and associated with Dr Isaac Watts. In the early 18th century, the park was accessed via the frontages and gardens of two large mansions \\u2014 her own manor house (Abney House), and the neighbouring Fleetwood House. Both mansions fronted onto Church Street in what was then a quiet Nonconformist village.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Parkland</h2>\\n<p>In the early 18th century, Lady Mary Abney laid out Abney Park after inheriting the Manor of Stoke Newington in 1701 from her brother Thomas Gunston. Initially she and her husband Sir Thomas Abney lived there part-time, also living at his residence in Hertfordshire. She began work on the park in those years.</p>\\n<p>After her husband's death in 1722, Lady Mary moved to Abney House full-time, becoming the first Lady of the Manor of Stoke Newington in her own right. She was said to be helped in designing the landscaping of the grounds as an English garden by the learned Dr Isaac Watts, who had been a long-term house guest of her and her late husband, and continued to live in her household. The neighbouring Hartopp family of Fleetwood House, who leased the eastern part of the park to Lady Mary, also helped with the park.</p>\\n<p>Her improvements included planting of the Great Elm Walk and Little Elm Walk, which established shady walkways down to the island heronry of the Hackney Brook at the bottom of the park. Both Wych Elm and English Elm were planted. The Hartopp family had already completed one of the early plantings of a Cedar of Lebanon tree in Great Britain, adjacent to an ornamental pond. This tree survived into the 1920s and is illustrated in many engravings of the period.</p>\\n<p>Other trees planted at an early date at Abney Park (either in the portion leased by Fleetwood House, or that attached solely to Abney House) included American Larch and Tulip Trees from the New World. The Nonconformists of Stoke Newington had strong connections to colonists in New England.</p>\\n<h2>Abney House</h2>\\n<p>Abney Park was dominated by Abney House. For some time in the early decades of the 19th century, it was the residence of James William Freshfield and his family.</p>\\n<p>In its final years, it was adapted for use as a Wesleyan Methodist training college or seminary (c.1838/9-1843). Rev. John Farrar was the governor of the college. He was elected Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its President. When the Methodists moved into their first purpose-built college at Richmond, south of London in 1843, Farrar was appointed as the Classical Tutor. He worked there until 1857.</p>\\n<p>After 1843, Abney House was 'recycled' (broken up for sale as building materials) for the building trade of the rapidly expanding metropolis, as was common in the Victorian era.</p>\\n<h2>Fleetwood House</h2>\\n<p>Fleetwood House was built in the 1630s for Sir Edward Hartopp. By marriage the estate passed to Charles Fleetwood, one of Oliver Cromwell's generals, and was named for him. It was later owned by various parties. from whom it got its name, and then through various parties. It served as a meeting place for Dissenters and Nonconformists, for which residents Stoke Newington was known.</p>\\n<p>In the grounds was a third building, called the Summerhouse. From 1774, it was used as a summer residence by the family of young James Stephen (1758-1832). Although not a Quaker, he became closely with the abolitionist cause, which they supported. In 1800, he married a sister of his friend William Wilberforce, who visited Stoke Newington regularly. Between them, the two men drafted the Slave Trade Act 1807, to prohibit the international slave trade originating in Africa.</p>\\n<p>In 1824, Fleetwood House was adapted for use as a new Quaker school, known as Newington Academy for Girls (also Newington College for Girls). In a time when girls' educational opportunities were limited, it offered a wide range of subjects (including sciences) \\\"on a plan in degree differing from any hitherto adopted\\\", according to the prospectus. It commissioned the world's first school bus, designed by George Shillibeer.</p>\\n<p>One of the school's founders was William Allen, a Quaker active with the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. His marriage to Grizell Hoare was the subject of a satirical cartoon, in which the school is referred to as the Newington Nunnery. Joseph Pease, later the first Quaker MP, wrote a doggerel verse praising Allen's marriage.</p>\\n<p>Fleetwood House was demolished in 1872. A fire station was constructed on the site.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Sources</h2>\\n<ul><li>Shirren, A.J.

It was incorporated into the Lee Valley Park in 1967. It was originally a true marsh, but was extensively drained from Medieval times, and rubble was dumped here from buildings damaged by air raids during World War II.</p>\\n<p>The principal area of the marsh lies below Lea Bridge Road between the Old River Lea, and the Hackney Cut \\u2013 an artificial channel of the Lee Navigation, dug about 1770, to avoid a loop in the natural watercourse. The southern extent is marked by the A12; although the industrial land around Hackney Wick Stadium was originally an extension of the marsh, it now forms a part of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Marsh is one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London, with 136.01 hectares (336.1 acres) of protected commons.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>The marsh</h3>\\n<p>The River itself was always an important waterway, being navigable to Hertfordshire; the Marsh was formed by the periodic flooding of the river, and so formed useful pasture, but could not be occupied permanently. Before the 10th century, the estuary of the river came as far as Hackney Wick, crossed at Old Ford. Marsh Road, the continuation of Homerton High Street, led to the marshes, and thence to Temple Mills. The Romans appear to have built a significant stone causeway across the marshes here; a periodical, the <i>Ambulator</i> of 1774, noted</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>there have been discovered within the last few years the remains of a great causeway of stone, which, by the Roman coins found there, would appear to have been one of the famous highways made by the Romans</i></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The river forms a natural boundary, so in 527\\u00a0AD it formed the boundary between the Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Middlesex. In the 9th century, it formed a part of the Danelaw boundary and reputedly, King Alfred stranded an invading Viking fleet here in 895\\u00a0AD. This was achieved by draining the river where it met the River Thames, but the increased drainage affected river navigability, until it was restored in the 17th century.</p>\\n<p>By medieval times, both sides had become counties in England, and attempts were made to control the flow of water through the marshes. Mills were established including the Knights Templar mill at Temple Mills. Much of the marsh was 'owned' by the Templars and used for pasture. When the Templars were abolished, the land passed to the Knights Hospitaller, and thence to the Crown during the Reformation, when monastic lands were seized. At this time, much of the land was associated with the Hackney village of Lower Homerton and with the large manor house at Hackney Wick.</p>\\n<p>Around 1770, the river was straightened by the construction of the Hackney Cut, now forming the eastern extent of the marsh. The natural watercourse passes to the east over the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, just below Lea Bridge Road. A nature reserve occupies the former Middlesex Filter beds on the island between the two watercourses.</p>\\n<p>By 1795, the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead (submerged in urine, and heated by decaying cow dung, the lead was converted to lead oxide, and then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint). A new watermill was established on the Crown land of the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.</p>\\n<p>At the end of the 19th century Hackney suffered from increased demand for building land, both for housing and to extend the factories in Homerton. The marshes had always suffered periodic flooding from the Lea but with the introduction of mains sewerage a flood relief sewer was constructed beneath the marshes. Most common and Lammas lands were then preserved by an Act of Parliament and passed to the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the marsh remained excluded from the MBW scheme because many of the lammas rights were still exercised, predominantly grazing. This was a period of increasing arguments between landowners and groups, such as the Eton Manor Mission, who were trying to use the marsh for recreation. The 337 acres (1.36\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of marshes were finally preserved by the London County Council in 1890, by purchasing the rights and landowners' interests for \\u00a375,000. They opened to the public in 1893 and were formally dedicated in 1894. The LCC undertook further flood prevention, straightening some of the bends in the River by introducing four 'cuts', the old channels being retained to form islands.</p>\\n\\n<p>There were few houses on the marshes, but a notable exception was the White House Inn, by a bridge on the old road to Leyton. Originally built as part of a Lea fishery scheme, the pub is now long gone but a bridge remains, rebuilt to supply anti-aircraft batteries during World War II.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>In the Marshes towards Hackney Wick were low public houses, the haunt of highwaymen and their Dulcineas. Dick Turpin was a constant guest at the \\\"White House,\\\" or \\\"Tyler's Ferry,\\\" near Joe Sowter's cock-pit at Temple Mills; and few police-officers were bold enough to approach the spot</i>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Small areas of the marsh have been taken for housing and sports fields and others added. 35.5 acres (144,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were taken in 1915 to build the 'National Projectile Factory'; after World War I, in 1922 this site was used to create the Mabley Green recreation ground. A further 22.5 acres (91,000\\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>) were taken in 1937 for the building of the Kingsmead Estate. The Lesney die cast model factory was built on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation in the 1940s, having success for many years with their <i>Matchbox</i> brand. The factory was a major local employer and closed in 1990.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Sport</h3>\\n<p>In 1881, men from Homerton College, then still in the London area, founded the Glyn Cricket Club. Members of the cricket club then decided to form a football section to keep fit during the winter months, this football section was to become the famous Clapton Orient Football Club which for thirty years played its home games at Millfields Road Stadium (1900\\u20131930). In 1946 the Club was renamed Leyton Orient and their home ground is now the Matchroom Stadium in Brisbane Road, Leyton, E10 5NF. Today the marshes provide many pleasant walks, in reach of the inner city, but the most famous use of Hackney Marshes is for Sunday league football, with 88 full-size football pitches marked out. On a typical Sunday, over 100 matches are played by amateur teams in several local leagues. This led in 2006 to a dispute between the London Borough of Hackney and Nike, Inc. over the company's use of the borough logo on their sportswear. The dispute was settled with payment of \\u00a3300,000 going to support local youth sports groups.</p>\\n<p>One of the most well known matches to be played on the marshes is games from The Hackney &amp; Leyton League</p>\\n<h3>London Olympics 2012</h3>\\n\\n<p>Part of the London Olympic park for the Summer Olympics of 2012 was built on Hackney Marshes. This caused some controversy with local residents' groups, who expressed concerns that East Marsh was to be tarmacked and used as a disabled coach park for the games. This was a temporary measure and restoration of the pitches has commenced -although it is behind schedule and unlikely to open in time for the start of the 2013 football season.</p>\\n<p>Arena Fields, however, was lost to the Olympic Park and its site will become part of the legacy Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park permanently. This area is to be replaced by parkland of comparable size and value on the Hackney side at the end of the 2012 Summer Olympics. It will not be possible to reinstate the loss of mature and varied trees or to compensate for the disruption caused to wildlife by construction.</p>\\n<p>The natural course of the River Lea forms the borough boundary with Waltham Forest and Newham (except for East Marsh, which lies between the river and Temple Mills). The Olympic plans included upgrading this watercourse and improving public access. The Olympic Park lies south of the A12, on industrial land around the former Hackney Stadium.</p>\\n<h2>Music, literature and film</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>The celebrated cockney music hall performer Gus Elen sang a song entitled <i>If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between</i> which included the following chorus:</li>\\n</ul><blockquote>\\n<p><i>Oh it really is a wery pretty garden<br>\\nAnd Chingford to the eastward could be seen;<br>\\n'Wiv a ladder and some glasses,<br>\\nYou could see to 'Ackney Marshes,<br>\\nIf it wasn't for the 'ouses in between.</i></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ul><li>In 1977, a 15 minute film was made celebrating the football on the marshes, by John Smith, and adapted for television the following year.</li>\\n<li>In 1997, Nike presented a selection of Premiership players turning out for the Sunday League teams to the soundtrack of Blur's \\\"Parklife\\\".</li>\\n<li>The 2005 film <i>Bullet Boy</i> (Saul Dibb) used the marshes and local streets as a location.</li>\\n<li>Radio 1's Hackney Weekend was held here on the marshes on 23 and 24 June 2012. with acts such as Jay-Z, Rihanna, will.i.am, Florence + The Machine, Leona Lewis and Plan B all performing across the two days.</li>\\n</ul><h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Transport and locale</h2>\\n<h3>Railway stations</h3>\\n<p>The area is not well served by transport, although boasts many buses.

Much of Hackney maintains its inner-city character and in places like Dalston large housing estates now sit side-by-side with gated communities. In South Hackney, near Victoria Park, there is terraced Victorian and Edwardian housing.</p>\\n<p>The historical and administrative heart of Hackney is the area roughly extending north from Mare Street and surrounding the Church of St John-at-Hackney; known as Hackney Central. To the north of the borough are Upper Clapton and Lower Clapton, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington. To the east is the large open space of Hackney Marshes and the districts of Hackney Wick and Homerton. Light industries in the area around the River Lea employ over 3,000 people and some were also used for the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<p>There are 1,300 listed buildings in Hackney, including the iconic Grade II* Hackney Empire, Tudor Sutton House, and the Grade I medieval St Augustine's Tower. The Borough contains 25 conservation areas including Clapton Square, and urban open-spaces including Clapton Common and Clissold Park. Conservation areas also protect large areas of Georgian and Victorian housing, and areas of industrial heritage.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n\\n<p>The borough was formed in 1965 from the area of the earlier metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington. The new council included representative symbols of the predecessor boroughs in its new combined coat of arms: Shoreditch by three bells from Shoreditch Church; Stoke Newington by two trees bearing fruit; and Hackney by the Maltese Cross of the principal landowners of the parish in the Middle Ages. The shield is surmounted by a representation of St. Augustine's Tower.</p>\\n<p>The council displays, in Hackney Town Hall, a portrait of the Queen wearing the robes of the Most Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem, of which she is Patron.</p>\\n<p>The borough has a rich history; the Roman road, Ermine Street, forms the western edge of the borough. Most of the rest of the land was covered with open oak and hazel woodlands, with marshland around the rivers and streams that crossed the area. Hackney lay within the Catuvellauni tribal territory. The eastern boundary of the borough is marked by the River Lea. This was an ancient boundary between pre-Roman tribes, and in the Roman era, was tidal up to Hackney Wick and continued to be the boundary between the historic counties of Middlesex and Essex.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the Tudor period the lands of religious orders were seized by the Crown and put up for sale. Thus Hackney became a retreat for the nobility around Hackney Central and Homerton, including Henry VIII's Palace by Lea Bridge roundabout, where BSix Sixth Form College stands today. Sutton House, on Homerton High Street, is the oldest surviving dwelling in Hackney, originally built as <i>Bryck Place</i> for Sir Ralph Sadleir, a diplomat, in 1535. The village of Hackney flourished from the Tudor to late Georgian periods as a rural retreat. The first documented \\\"hackney coach\\\"\\u2014the forerunner of the more generic \\\"hackney carriage\\\"\\u2014operated in London in 1621. Current opinion is that the name \\\"hackney,\\\" to refer to a London taxi, is derived from the village name. (Hackney, through its historical fame for its horses and horse-drawn carriages, is also the root of the Spanish word <i>jaca</i>, a term used for a small breed of horse, and the Sardinian achetta horse.) Hackney's rural reputation brought to an end by the construction of the railway in the 1850s.</p>\\n\\n<p>London's first Tudor theatres were built at Shoreditch and the Gunpowder Plot was first exposed nearby in Hoxton too.</p>\\n<p>Notable residents from the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries included Robert Aske, William Cecil, Samuel Courtauld, Samuel Hoare, Joseph Priestley and Thomas Sutton.</p>\\n<p>Many grand houses stood in Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill, with the latter providing a haven for Hackney's many Orthodox Jewish residents from the 1930s. Alfred Hitchcock made many of his first films in Hoxton at the Gainsborough Studios in Poole Street.</p>\\n<p>After industrialisation, extensive post-war development and immigration, the area's many Georgian and Victorian terraces are being gentrified, warehouses are being converted and new apartments are being built. It was inner London's 'greenest borough' and London Transport's 'best bike borough 2006', with 62 parks and open spaces, covering 815 acres (3.3\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>). Seven Hackney parks have now achieved Green Flag status. One, Abney Park, became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain's historic park and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Hackney Marshes play host to the largest collection of football pitches in Europe; and was the site of part of the 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>\\n<h2>Governance</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>The borough comprises two parliamentary constituencies: Hackney North and Stoke Newington (represented by Diane Abbott MP) and Hackney South and Shoreditch (represented by Meg Hillier MP); both are Privy Counsellors and Labour Party Members of Parliament. The borough is in the North East London Assembly constituency returning Jennette Arnold AM, as the directly elected Assembly Member. Hackney is part of the London constituency in the European Parliament.</p>\\n<p>Unlike most other English local authorities, the Borough is now governed by a directly-elected Mayor who is also the political leader of the Council. The Mayor\\u00a0\\u2013 currently Jules Pipe CBE\\u00a0\\u2013 is supported by a cabinet, councillors and a Speaker who fulfils the civic and ceremonial duties previously undertaken by the (non-political) mayor.</p>\\n<p>At the Hackney Council election on 6 May 2010 the Labour Party were returned with 50 Councillors; winning six additional seats. The Conservative Party forms the largest opposition party on the Council with four Councillors; and the Liberal Democrats have three.</p>\\n<p><i>City's councils get top ratings</i> (BBC News) Every ward remains among the 10% most deprived in the country, with 47% of children living in low income households.</p>\\n<p>Hackney has a reputation as one of the most crime-ridden London boroughs, and some of its streets have even been referred to as \\\"Murder Mile\\\", but cooperation between local police and council has resulted in the borough experiencing a bigger drop in crime than in any other London borough in the four-year period up to 2007 (28% reduction).</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n<h3>Location</h3>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney is an Inner London Borough within Greater London. It is to the north-east of the City of London; and neighboured by the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, to the south; Islington to the west at Southgate Road; Haringey to the north. On the east, the River Lea forms the boundary with Waltham Forest; and to the south-east is Newham. Historically, the River Lea formed the boundary between the predecessor counties of Middlesex and Essex.</p>\\n<p>Hackney Town Hall is approximately 5 miles (8\\u00a0km) north-east of Charing Cross, St Pauls Cathedral being situated in between; and 3.8 miles (6.1\\u00a0km) from the GLA City Hall near Tower Bridge.</p>\\n<h3>Districts and postcodes</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>The most southerly district in the borough is Shoreditch, adjacent to the City. To the north-west, bordering Islington, the City, and north of Old Street is Hoxton. To the north of Shoreditch is Haggerston, north of the Regents Canal. Bethnal Green also forms of the southern parts of the borough, also this is formally and majoritised within neighbouring Tower Hamlets.</p>\\n<p>Settlements to the west of the borough followed the line of the former Ermine Street, with De Beauvoir Town\\u00a0\\u2014 a Victorian estate to the west of the (now) Kingsland Road. Further north, lie Dalston, Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill\\u00a0\\u2014 where the borough abuts Haringey.</p>\\n<p>A further group of settlements follow another north-south radial road, with South Hackney to the east of Cambridge Heath Road\\u00a0\\u2014 north of Victoria Park; and Hackney Central commencing at Mare Street. London Fields was formerly common land to the west of this place, but now forms a district in its own right. To the north, Homerton lies immediately east of the centre of Hackney. The River Lea forms the borough's eastern boundary. Hackney Wick, the Hackney Marshes, Lower and Upper Clapton all lie along this eastern boundary.</p>\\n<p>Postal districts were assigned to the former parts of the borough in 1857/8. Most of the borough would originally have been covered by a planned 'NE' postal district, but this was abolished in 1866. Most of the borough is covered by the eastern postal district, but Shoreditch constitutes five separate postcodes. Areas to the west of Kingsland Road and in the north of the borough are predominantly covered by the northern postal district.</p>\\n<p>Traditionally, much of the borough was and remains considered as a part of East London, with Hoxton and Shoreditch being part of the East End of London. In the 2008 revision of the London Plan, the borough was officially reassigned to the north London sub-region for administrative purposes.</p>\\n<h3>Topography</h3>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney covers an area of 19.06 square kilometres (7.4\\u00a0sq\\u00a0mi). Its primary geographic feature is the course of the River Lea; and the associated River Lee Navigation, which passes through Hackney Cut\\u00a0\\u2014 an artificial channel of the Lea built in 1770 across the Hackney Marshes to straighten a meander of the natural river. A tributary of the Lea, Hackney Brook was fully culverted in 1860 by the Metropolitan Board of Works.</p>\\n<p>The New River passes through the borough close to Finsbury Park and flows towards Islington. The Regents Canal also crosses the borough to the south of De Beauvoir Town in the west, joining the Hertford Union Canal below Victoria Park.</p>\\n<p>Within the Borough, the land rises westward from the Lea reaching 30 metres (98\\u00a0ft) above sea level at Clapton Common and Stamford Hill. The area around Victoria Park, in the south of the borough lies about 15 metres (49\\u00a0ft) above sea level. At Spring Hill, in Upper Clapton the road descends sharply from 25 metres (82\\u00a0ft) to only 10 metres (33\\u00a0ft) at High Hill Ferry, on the Lee Navigation.</p>\\n<h3>Geology</h3>\\n<p>The Lea and Hackney Marshes are underlain by alluvium soils; and the higher ground between Homerton and Stamford Hill is formed on a widening bed of London Clay. Brickearth deposits are within tongues of clay extending beneath Clapton Common, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington High Street. The centre and south western districts lie on river terrace deposits of Taplow Gravel. Victoria Park and Well Street Common lie on flood plain gravel.</p>\\n<h3>Climate</h3>\\n<p>This data was taken between 1971 and 2000 at the nearest national weather station in Greenwich; around 7 miles (11.3\\u00a0km) south of Hackney Town Hall:</p>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>Demography</h2>\\n<p>In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 14,609. This rose steadily throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; reaching 95,000 in the middle of that century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased\\u00a0\\u2014 reaching nearly 374,000 by the turn of the century. This increase in population peaked before World War I, falling slowly in the aftermath until World War II began an exodus from London towards the new towns under the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944). The population is now rising again, and the 2001 census gives Hackney a population of 202,824.</p>\\n<p>The population is ethnically diverse. Of the resident population, 89,490 (41%) people describe themselves as White British. 30,978 (14%) are in other White ethnic groups, 63,009 (29%) are Black or Black British, 20,000 (9%) are Asian or Asian British, 8,501 (4%) describe themselves as 'Mixed', and 6,432 (3%) as Chinese or Other.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is also a large Turkish and Kurdish population resident in Hackney. Turkish and Kurdish communities are located in all parts of the borough, though there is a greater concentration in north and central Hackney.</p>\\n<p>132,931 (66%) of the resident population were British born. A further 10,095 (5%) were born in other parts of Europe, and the remaining 59,798 (29%) born elsewhere in the world.</p>\\n<p>The 2001 census also shows Christianity is the biggest religion in Hackney, with 44% of residents identifying Christian; 18% identified as Muslim, 4% Jewish, and 3% belonged to other religions. A further 19% stated no religion, and 12% did not state a response. By the 2011 census, residents identifying themselves as Christian fell to 38.6%, whilst those with no religion rose to 28.2%. Judaism had a modest increase, Islam had a small increase, and Hinduism made a slight drop.</p>\\n<p>32% of households are owner\\u2013occupied.</p>\\n<p>The largest rise of ethnic groups between 2001 and 2011 was 'Other', which increased by 222%. This was followed by 'Mixed', which rose by 84%.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>In 2002, the borough entered into a ten-year contract with the <i>Learning Trust</i>, an independent collaborative body that organises education for Hackney's 27,000 pupils in over 70 schools, nurseries and play centres. The trust was set up in response to an OFSTED report that identified failings in the then existing system. Two of London's most successful City Academies are in Hackney with another two in development and plans to rebuild or renovate every other Hackney school by 2016.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<p>Hackney is hardly served by London Underground services: Only Manor House, located on its extreme north-western fringe on the boundary with Haringey, though Old Street sits only a few metres south-west of Hackney in Islington.</p>\\n<p>However, two London Overground lines serve Hackney: the North London Line crosses from west to east while the East London Line runs from Highbury &amp; Islington and passes through Dalston Junction and on south through Haggerston, Hoxton, Shoreditch towards destinations south of the River Thames, including Clapham Junction, Crystal Palace, Croydon, and New Cross.</p>\\n<p>Additionally National Rail's Lea Valley Lines also pass through Hackney, with stations at London Fields, Hackney Downs, Rectory Road, Stoke Newington, Stamford Hill, and Clapton.</p>\\n<p>It is proposed that Crossrail 2, the 'Chelsea-Hackney Line', would provide a direct Underground service to Hackney Central, Dalston and Homerton, although it is currently undecided whether this would be built as London Underground or main line specifications.</p>\\n\\n<h3>London Overground</h3>\\n<p><b>North London Line</b> Travelling west to east\\u00a0\\u2014 nearest London Overground stations are <i>Dalston Kingsland</i>, <i>Hackney Central</i>, <i>Homerton</i> and <i>Hackney Wick</i></p>\\n<p><b>East London Line</b> Travelling north to south\\u00a0\\u2014 nearest London Overground stations are <i>Dalston Junction</i>, <i>Haggerston</i>, <i>Hoxton</i> and <i>Shoreditch High Street</i></p>\\n<h3>Lea Valley Lines</h3>\\n<p>These stations are served by Abellio Greater Anglia:</p>\\n<ul><li>Stamford Hill railway station</li>\\n<li>Stoke Newington railway station</li>\\n<li>Rectory Road railway station</li>\\n<li>Clapton railway station</li>\\n<li>Hackney Downs railway station</li>\\n<li>London Fields railway station</li>\\n</ul><h3>Travel to work</h3>\\n<p>In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: bus, minibus or coach, 16.9% of all residents aged 16\\u201374; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 9.2%; bicycle, 9.2%; on foot, 7.5%; driving a car or van, 7.1%; train, 4.6%; work mainly at or from home, 3.5%.</p>\\n<h2>Notable associated people</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Notable attractions and institutions</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Abney Park Cemetery \\u2013 overgrown Victorian cemetery and Nature Reserve</li>\\n<li>Arcola Theatre \\u2013 studio theatre</li>\\n<li>National Centre of Circus Arts \\u2013 circus school</li>\\n<li>Geffrye Museum \\u2013 decorative arts museum</li>\\n<li>Hackney Empire \\u2013 theatre</li>\\n<li>Hoxton Hall \\u2013 community centre and performance space</li>\\n<li>Newington Green Unitarian Church \\u2013 London's oldest nonconformist place of worship</li>\\n<li>St John's Hoxton \\u2013 Anglican church (where \\\"Amazing Grace\\\" was written)</li>\\n<li>Shoreditch Town Hall</li>\\n<li>Sutton House \\u2013 Heritage house and museum</li>\\n<li>The Towers of Hackney</li>\\n<li>Transition Gallery \\u2013 contemporary art project space</li>\\n<li>Victoria Miro Gallery \\u2013 contemporary art gallery</li>\\n<li>Vortex Jazz Club \\u2013 live jazz venue</li>\\n<li>White Cube \\u2013 contemporary commercial art gallery</li>\\n</ul><h2>Twinned towns</h2>\\n<p>The London Borough of Hackney has formal twinning arrangements with:</p>\\n<p>And an informal twinning with</p>\\n<dl><dd> Alexandra, South Africa.</dd>\\n</dl><p>The borough also has informal links with South Africa, Turkey, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

The area of Hoxton is bordered by Regent's Canal on the north side, Wharf Road and City Road to the west, Old Street to the south, and Kingsland Road to the east.</p>\\n<p>Hoxton is also a ward, electing three councillors to Hackney London Borough Council. It forms part of the Hackney South and Shoreditch constituency.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Historical Hoxton</h2>\\n<h3>Origins</h3>\\n<p>\\\"Hogesdon\\\" is first recorded in the Domesday Book, meaning an Anglo-Saxon farm (or \\\"fortified enclosure\\\") belonging to <i>Hoch</i>, or <i>Hocq</i>. Little is recorded of the origins of the settlement, though there was Roman activity around Ermine Street, which ran to the east of the area from the 1st century. In medieval times, Hoxton formed a rural part of Shoreditch parish. It achieved independent ecclesiastical status in 1826 with the founding of its own parish church dedicated to St John the Baptist, though civil jurisdiction was still invested in the Shoreditch vestry. The Worshipful Company of Haberdashers remains Patron of the advowson of the parish of St John's.</p>\\n<p>In 1415, the Lord Mayor of London \\\"caused the wall of the City to be broken towards Moorfields, and built the postern called Moorgate, for the ease of the citizens to walk that way upon causeways towards Islington and Hoxton\\\" \\u2013 at that time, still marshy areas. The residents responded by harassing walkers to protect their fields. A century later, the hedges and ditches were destroyed, by order of the City, to enable City dwellers to partake in leisure at Hoxton.</p>\\n<h3>Tudor Hoxton</h3>\\n<p>By Tudor times many moated manor houses existed to provide ambassadors and courtiers country air nearby the City. This included many Catholics, attracted by the house of the Portuguese Ambassador, who, in his private chapel, celebrated the masses forbidden in a Protestant country. One such resident was Sir Thomas Tresham, who was imprisoned here by Elizabeth I of England for harbouring Catholic priests. The open fields to the north and west were frequently used for archery practice, and on 22 September 1598 the playwright Ben Jonson fought a fatal duel in Hoxton Fields, killing actor Gabriel Spencer. Jonson was able to prove his literacy, thereby claiming benefit of clergy to escape a hanging.</p>\\n<p>Hoxton's public gardens were a popular resort from the overcrowded City streets, and it is reputed that the name of Pimlico came from the publican, Ben Pimlico, and his particular brew.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><i>Have at thee, then, my merrie boyes, and beg for old Ben Pimlico\\u2019s nut-brown ale</i>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The gardens appear to have been situated near Hoxton Street, known at that time, as <i>Pimlico Path</i>. The modern area of Pimlico derives its name from its former use in Hoxton.</p>\\n<h3>Gunpowder, treason and a letter</h3>\\n\\n<p>On 26 October 1605 Hoxton achieved notoriety, when a letter arrived at the home of local resident William Parker, Lord Monteagle warning him not to attend the Parliament summoned by James I to convene on 5 November, because \\\"yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow, the Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them\\\". The letter may have been sent by his brother-in-law Francis Tresham, or he may have written it himself, to curry favour. The letter was read aloud at supper, before prominent Catholics, and then he delivered it personally to Robert Cecil at Whitehall. While the conspirators were alerted, by the public reading, to the existence of the letter they persevered with their plot as their gunpowder remained undiscovered. William Parker accompanied Thomas Howard, the Lord Chamberlain, at his visit to the undercroft of Parliament, where Guy Fawkes was found in the early hours of 5 November. Most of the conspirators fled on the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, but Francis Tresham was arrested a few days later at his house in Hoxton. A commemorative plaque is attached to modern flats at the site of Parker's house in Hoxton Street.</p>\\n<h3>Almshouses and madhouses</h3>\\n<p>By the end of the 17th century the nobility's estates began to be broken up. Many of these large houses became to be used as schools, hospitals or mad houses, with almshouses being built on the land between by benefactors, most of whom were City liverymen. Aske's Almshouses were built on Pitfield Street in 1689 from Robert Aske's endowment for 20 poor haberdashers and a school for 20 children of freemen. Hoxton House, was established as a private asylum in 1695. It was owned by the Miles family, and expanded rapidly into the surrounding streets being described by Coleridge as <i>the</i> Hoxton madhouse. Here fee-paying 'gentle and middle class' people took their exercise in the extensive grounds between Pitfield Street and Kingsland Road; including the poet Charles Lamb. Over 500 pauper lunatics resided in closed wards, and it remained the Naval Lunatic Asylum until 1818. The asylum closed in 1911; and the only remains are by Hackney Community College, where a part of the house was incorporated into the school that replaced it in 1921. At this time Hoxton Square and Charles Square were laid out, forming a fashionable area. Non-conformist sects were attracted to the area, away from the restrictions of the City's regulations.</p>\\n<h3>Victorian era and 20th century</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the Victorian era the railways made travelling to distant suburbs easier, and this combined with infill building and industrialisation to drive away the wealthier classes, leaving Hoxton a concentration of the poor with many slums. The area became a centre for the furniture trade.</p>\\n<p>Charles Booth in <i>Life and Labour of the People in London</i> of 1902 gave the following description:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The character of the whole locality is working-class. Poverty is everywhere, with a considerable admixture of the very poor and vicious\\u00a0... Large numbers have been and are still being displaced by the encroachment of warehouses and factories\\u00a0... Hoxton is known for its costers and Curtain criminals, for its furniture trade\\u00a0... No servants</p>\\n<p>are kept except in the main Road shopping streets and in a few remaining middle class squares in the west.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In Hoxton Street, a plaque marks the location of the Britannia Theatre. This evolved from the former Pimlico tea gardens, a tavern and a saloon, into a 3,000-seat theatre, designed by Finch Hill. Together with the nearby Pollock's Toy Museum, it was destroyed in Second World War bombing. Hoxton Hall, also in Hoxton Street, which survives as a community centre, began life in 1863 as a 'saloon style' music hall. It remains largely in its original form, as for many years it was used as a Quaker meeting house. There was also the 1870 Varieties Music Hall (by C. J. Phipps) in nearby Pitfield Street, this became a cinema in 1910, closing in 1941. Since 2003 the site has remained empty, but in 2008 it was gutted and prepared for a refurb. Local opposition to the design has resulted in the project being put on hold, so it now remains empty and \\\"For Sale\\\".</p>\\n<p>In the former vestry of St Leonard Shoreditch Electric Light Station, just to the north of Hoxton Market, is based The Circus Space. Inside, the \\\"Generating Chamber\\\" and \\\"Combustion Chamber\\\" provide facilities for circus training and production. The building was constructed by the Vestry in 1895 to burn local rubbish and generate electricity. It also provided steam to heat the public baths. This replaced an earlier facility providing gas-light, located in Shoreditch.</p>\\n<p>Gainsborough Studios were located in a former power station, in Poole Street, by the Regents Canal. The film studios operated there from 1924 to 1951. An historical plaque is attached to the building, now a modern apartment block, that occupies the site since the studios' demolition in 2002. The plaque reads</p>\\n<dl><dd><i>London Borough of Hackney</i></dd>\\n<dd><i>The Gainsborough Film Studios 1924\\u20131949</i></dd>\\n<dd><i>Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Balcon, Ivor Novello, Gracie Fields, \\\"The Lady Vanishes\\\", \\\"The Wicked Lady\\\" worked and were filmed here</i></dd>\\n</dl><p>With a new-found popularity, large parts of Hoxton have been gentrified; this has inevitably aroused hostility among some local residents, who believe they are being priced out of the area. Some parts of Hoxton, however, remain deprived with council housing dominating the landscape.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Today</h3>\\n<p>The geographical distinction between Hoxton and Shoreditch is often confused. The two districts have a historical link as part of the same manor, and in the 19th century both formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch. This was incorporated into the newly created London Borough of Hackney in 1965, but old street signs bearing the name are still to be found throughout the area.</p>\\n<p>Manufacturing developments in the years after the Second World War meant that many of the small industries that characterised Hoxton moved out. By the early 1980s, these industrial lofts and buildings came to be occupied by young artists as inexpensive live/work spaces, while exhibitions, raves and clubs occupied former office and retail space at the beginning of the 1990s. During this time Joshua Compston established his Factual Nonsense gallery on Charlotte Road in Shoreditch and organised art fetes in Hoxton Square. Their presence gradually drew other creative industries into the area, especially magazines, design firms, and dot-coms.</p>\\n<p>By the end of the 20th century, the southern half of Hoxton had become a vibrant arts and entertainment district boasting a large number of bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and art galleries. In this period, the new Hoxton residents could be identified by their obscurely fashionable (or \\\"ironically\\\" unfashionable) clothes and their hair (the so-called \\\"Hoxton Fin\\\", as exemplified by Fran Healy of Travis). The excesses and fashion-centricity of Hoxton and Shoreditch denizens have been satirised in the satirical magazine <i>Shoreditch Twat</i>, on the TVGoHome website, and in the sitcom <i>Nathan Barley</i>. This fashionable area centres around Hoxton Square, a small park bordered mainly by former industrial buildings, as well as the elegant 19th century parish church of St John's.</p>\\n<p>The northern half of the district is more residential and contains many council housing estates and new-build private residences. Residents are typically older and the unemployment and crime rates, with the exceptions of drug offences, robbery and theft, are relatively high compared to some parts of the borough. Hoxton Street Market is the focal point of this end of the district. The market sells a wide range of household goods during the week and specialises in independent fashion, art and design products on Saturdays. Nearby is the Geffrye Museum and Hoxton War Memorial.</p>\\n<p>Property prices have continued to rise steeply since the early years of the 21st century as property developers have moved to cash in on the area's trendy image, central location and transport links. Some galleries have, as a result, moved to nearby Shoreditch, or have relocated further afield to cheaper districts such as London Fields or Bethnal Green. In response, the local council formed a not-for-profit corporation, Shoreditch Our Way (now called The Shoreditch Trust), to buy local buildings and lease them out as community facilities and housing. The extension of the East London Line (completed in 2010), has provided the local rail access which was lost when the line from Broad Street closed to services.</p>\\n<h3>Hoxton Market</h3>\\n<p>Hoxton Market, which is now in Hoxton Street rather than its original site to the west of Hoxton Square, was founded in 1687. This market was the cornerstone of the local community but, from the 1980s onwards, changed from a thriving market to one that lost its trade to the move towards supermarkets and away from the traditional street market meeting all of the community's needs. In 2013 the local business community, working with the Council, started work to revive the market and this has attracted great attention and increased trade, complemented by new shops opening along the length of the market.</p>\\n<h2>People with Hoxton links</h2>\\n\\n<ul><li>Charles Bradlaugh, founder of the National Secular Society in 1866, was born in Hoxton.</li>\\n<li>Frank Chapple, union leader, was born and raised in Hoxton.

It is bounded by the Hackney districts of Stamford Hill to the west, Lower Clapton and Lea Bridge to the south and the Haringey district of South Tottenham to the north. To the east is the River Lea (spelled Lea or Lee), on the other side of which is the expanse of the Walthamstow Marshes, part of which is in the Lee Valley Park.</p>\\n<p>As is frequently the case with London districts, these boundaries have become uncertain because of the meeting of the developing expansion of the original settlements. Western parts of the area are often considered part of a wider Stamford Hill, understandable perhaps because of the public transport junction and shopping area at Stamford Broadway, and that the Hassidic Jewish community identified as being located in Stamford Hill extends into Upper Clapton.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Clapton was from 1339 until the 18th century normally rendered as <i>Clopton</i>, meaning the \\\"farm on the hill\\\". The Old English <i>clop</i> - \\\"lump\\\" or \\\"hill\\\" - presumably denoted the high ground which rises from the River Lea. Eventually encompassing the north-eastern quarter of the parish, Clapton grew up along the way which in 1745 was called Hackney Lane, part of which ran through Broad (later Clapton) Common. Building spread to meet streets east of the high road and north of Homerton in the 19th century. Manorial courts from the early 19th century distinguished the parts north and south of Lea Bridge Road as Upper and Lower Clapton, and those names soon passed into general use. Hackney Lane came to be known as Lower and Upper Clapton roads, until in the late 19th century the stretch through the common to Stamford Hill was named Clapton Common.</p>\\n<p>The area, along with Lower Clapton, was known in the 1990s and early 2000s for drug and gun related crimes, gaining it the nickname \\\"Murder Mile.\\\" As well as being featured in the film <i>Bullet Boy</i>, Clapton's reputation was highlighted in an episode of Channel 4's satirical TV show <i>Brass Eye</i> in 1997, which claimed that the petrol station is shoplifted every 30 minutes.</p>\\n<h2>Local features</h2>\\n<h3>On the waterfront</h3>\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the most pleasant amenities in Upper Clapton is Springfield Park, which extends down the hill eastwards to the Lea. This park was created in 1905 from the extensive grounds of three mansions, of which only one survives: Springfield House, now known as the White House (a Grade II listed house ), houses a caf\\u00e9 and the municipal rangers' station. The park's sports facilities include five tennis courts and a cricket pitch, while to the north, just across Spring Hill in the recreation ground, there are rugby fields (home of the Hackney RUFC), more tennis courts, and football pitches. Across the Lea, on the ancient Essex and modern London Borough of Waltham Forest border, is Springfield Marina, a packed mooring for narrowboats and other waterway craft, while on the other bank of the river is the Lea Rowing Club.</p>\\n<p>The park received a Green Flag award in July 2008.</p>\\n<p>Aside from the mansion, another \\u2014 and very popular \\u2014 survivor is the Anchor and Hope pub, which is not far from the south-east corner of the park. The area along the Lea was heavily bombed in the Second World War, and the pub is one of the few survivors of the terraced housing that once dominated the area. It is now quite overshadowed by pre- and post-war blocks of flats.</p>\\n<p>Besides Springfield Park, Upper Clapton is delineated to the west by the long leafy strip of Clapton Common, distinguished by the recently regenerated pond (the name Clapton Pond, however, is generally applied by locals to a set of two much smaller ex-reservoirs in Lower Clapton, and bus routes that use Clapton Pond as a terminus point are referring to Lower Clapton). The pond is a favourite with bird watchers \\u2014 besides the usual variety of ducks, geese and swans, such shy birds as grebes and other waders may often be seen feeding in the reed beds.</p>\\n<h3>The Abode of Love</h3>\\n\\n<p>Upper Clapton is home to one of London's more unusual churches, the Church of the Good Shepherd, which was used as a place of worship by the Ancient Catholic Church and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church. However, the church was originally built by the Agapemonite cult in 1892 as the Church of the Ark of the Covenant.</p>\\n<p>The Agapemonites, who held decidedly unconventional views on marriage and the role of women, relocated to Upper Clapton from their spiritual community in Spaxton, Somerset, and had clearly prospered by this time. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, the outside of the church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth from the base of the steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J S Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'.</p>\\n<p>The church, which was completed in 1895, was designed by Joseph Morris in a Gothic Revival style; for its \\\"curiosity value\\\" it was designated a Grade II-listed building on 12 September 1969.</p>\\n\\n<p>The cult had always been surrounded by scandal during its sojourn in Somerset and, after the move to Clapton, this degenerated into sheer farce. The original leader, Henry James Prince, who claimed to be immortal, died in 1899 and was succeeded by the charming but philandering John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, who wasted no time before declaring himself as the Messiah. Challenged by a jeering mob to prove his godhood by walking across Clapton Pond, Smyth-Pigott declined and retired to Somerset, where he was said to enjoy the favours of as many as seven \\\"spiritual brides\\\" a week. Smyth-Pigott, who also claimed immortality, died in 1927, after which the cult went into decline. The Clapton church had already been abandoned by the cult and was acquired first by the Ancient Catholic Church in 1956, and then by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 2005.</p>\\n<h3>The New Synagogue</h3>\\n\\n<p>Close by the Good Shepherd is the stately New Synagogue, on the eastern side of Clapton Common. This Grade II listed building is a little deceptive, appearing much older than it actually is. In spite of its handsome Georgian-style exterior, this is actually post-Edwardian, built in 1915. It is, however, a faithful replica of an earlier building, the Great St Helen's Synagogue in the City of London, which was designed by John Davies in 1838. The current building contains a number of original fixtures from its predecessor. Endangered for a while, the synagogue was restored in 2005.</p>\\n<h3>Brooke House</h3>\\n\\n<p>A large house known as the King's House stood on the site now occupied by BSix Sixth Form College, as early 1476. The house was within a 200-acre (0.81\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) estate, which was described as the Manor of Hackney from about 1532 to the early 17th century \\u2014 although there were two other manors in the south of the Parish.</p>\\n<p>In 1532, Henry Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland, acquired the estate from Sir Richard Neville. However, in January 1535 the land was taken by Henry VIII; in settlement of a debt. The King visited the house in April 1535 and on 24 September 1535 he granted his \\\"manor or principal messuage of Hackney\\\" to Thomas Cromwell, his chief minister. Cromwell refurbished the house, and on 1 May 1536, returned the house to the King. In July 1536, Ralph Sadleir brought Mary I of England to the house to swear the Oath of Supremacy before her father, and Jane Seymour, the Queen. Henry continued to own the house until his death in January 1547. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, died in the house in Hackney known as the \\\"King's House\\\" on 24 June 1604.</p>\\n<p>The name of the house derives from its purchase by Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, in 1621 \\u2014 which led to ownership by the family for over 200 years. The house became tenanted after 1724, but in 1758\\u20139 the house was modified by a leasee, William Clarke who converted it to a lunatic asylum. The site remained in this use until 1940.</p>\\n<p>The remains of the house were destroyed by enemy action in October 1940. 5.5 acres (0.02\\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>) of Brooke House were purchased by the London County Council in 1944, and further bomb damage occurred that year. The house was finally demolished in 1954, and archaeological investigations of the Tudor palace took place in 1955\\u20136. New school buildings were erected in 1960, designed by Armstrong and MacManus.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>BSix Sixth Form College is a sixth form college on a site near the Lea Bridge roundabout in Clapton.</p>\\n<h2>Transport and locale</h2>\\n\\n<p>About 2 miles by bus, the nearest London Underground stations are Tottenham Hale, Manor House and Seven Sisters.</p>\\n<dl><dt>Nearest railway stations</dt>\\n</dl><ul><li>Clapton</li>\\n<li>Hackney Central</li>\\n<li>South Tottenham</li>\\n<li>Stamford Hill</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>History of Clapton (British History Online)</li>\\n<li>Clapton at freeservers.com</li>\\n<li>The Lee Valley Park</li>\\n<li>The Spark Caf\\u00e9</li>\\n<li>BSix College Brooke House Website</li>\\n<li>The Clapton Messiah The Agapemonites - Clapton Pond Neighbourhood Action Group</li>\\n<li>The Agapemonites - Clapton Freeservers</li>\\n<li>The New Synagogue (from oldsynagogues.org - shows the impressive interior)</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2389.1,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":9505961,\"title\":\"Maxwell Hutchinson\",\"text\":\"<p>Hutchinson also played guitar for some time for Lene Lovich, for whom Judge Smith wrote.

Located 3.3 miles (5.3\\u00a0km) northeast of Charing Cross, it was historically an agrarian hamlet in the ancient parish of Stepney, Middlesex.</p>\\n<p>Following population increases caused by the expansion of London during the 18th century, it was split off from Stepney as the parish of Bethnal Green in 1743, becoming part of the Metropolis in 1855 and the County of London in 1889. The parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green in 1900 and the population peaked in 1901, entering a period of steady decline which lasted until 1981.</p>\\n<p>The economic history of Bethnal Green is characterised by a shift away from agricultural provision for the City of London to market gardening, weaving and light industry, which has now all but disappeared. The quality of the built environment had deteriorated by the turn of the 20th century and was radically reformed by the aerial bombardment of World War II and the subsequent social housing developments. Some 173 people were killed at a single incident at Bethnal Green tube station in 1943. Bethnal Green has formed part of Greater London since 1965.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<h3>Toponymy</h3>\\n<p>The place-name <i>Blithehale</i> or <i>Blythenhale</i>, the earliest form of Bethnal Green, is derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>healh</i> ('angle, nook, or corner') and <i>blithe</i> ('happy, blithe'), or from a personal name <i>Blitha</i>. Nearby Cambridge Heath (<i>Camprichesheth</i>), is unconnected with Cambridge and may also derive from an Anglo-Saxon personal name. The area was once marshland and forest which, as <i>Bishopswood</i>, lingered in the east until the 16th century. A settlement's dependence upon water suggests that the 'happy corner' was cleared next to the natural spring, St. Winifred's Well, in Conduit Field at the northern end of the Green. Over time, the name became <i>Bethan Hall Green</i>, which, because of local pronunciation as <i>Beth'n 'all Green</i>, had by the 19th century changed to <i>Bethnal Green</i>.</p>\\n<h3>Early History</h3>\\n\\n<p>A Tudor ballad, the <i>Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</i>, tells the story of an ostensibly poor man who gave a surprisingly generous dowry for his daughter's wedding. The tale furnishes the parish of Bethnal Green's coat of arms. According to one version of the legend, found in Percy's <i>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</i> published in 1765, the beggar was said to be Henry, the son of Simon de Montfort, but Percy himself declared that this version was not genuine. The Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel is reputed to be the site of his begging.</p>\\n<p>Boxing has a long association with Bethnal Green. Daniel Mendoza, who was champion of England from 1792 to 1795 though born in Aldgate, lived in Paradise Row on the western side of Bethnal Green for 30 years. Since then numerous boxers have been associated with the area, and the local leisure centre, York Hall, remains notable for presentation of boxing bouts.</p>\\n<p>In 1841, the Anglo-Catholic Nathaniel Woodard, who was to become a highly influential educationalist in the later part of the 19th century, became the curate of the newly created St. Bartholomew's in Bethnal Green. He was a capable pastoral visitor and established a parochial school. In 1843, he got into trouble for preaching a sermon in St. Bartholomew's in which he argued that <i>the Book of Common Prayer</i> should have additional material to provide for confession and absolution and in which he criticised the 'inefficient and Godless clergy' of the Church of England. After examining the text of the sermon, the Bishop of London condemned it as containing 'erroneous and dangerous notions'. As a result, the bishop sent Woodard to be a curate in Clapton.</p>\\n<h3>The Green and Poor's Land</h3>\\n<p>The Green and Poor's Land is the area of open land now occupied by Bethnal Green Library, the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood and St John's Church, designed by John Soane. In Stow's <i>Survey of London</i> (1598) the hamlet was called <i>Blethenal Green</i>, now called <i>Bethnal Green</i>. It was one of the hamlets included in the Manor of Stepney and Hackney. Hackney later became separated.</p>\\n<p>In 1678 the owners of houses surrounding the Green purchased the land to save it from being built on and in 1690 the land was conveyed to a trust under which it was to be kept open and rent from it used for the benefit of poor people living in the vicinity. From that date until now the trust has administered the land and its minute books are kept in the London Metropolitan Archives.</p>\\n<p>Bethnal House, or Kirby's Castle, was the principal house on the Green. One of its owners was Sir Hugh Platt (1552\\u20131608), author of books on gardening and practical science. Under its next owner it was visited by Samuel Pepys. It became associated with the ballad of the Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (see Thomas Percy).</p>\\n<p>In 1727 it was leased to Matthew Wright and for almost two centuries it was a mad house. Its two most distinguished inmates were Alexander Cruden, compiler of the <i>Concordance to the Bible</i>, and the poet Christopher Smart. Cruden recorded his experience in <i>The London Citizen Grievously Injured</i> (1739) and Smart's stay there is recorded by his daughter. Records of the asylum are kept in the annual reports of the Commissioner in Lunacy. Even today, the park where the library stands is known locally as \\u201cBarmy Park\\u201d.</p>\\n<p>The original mansion, the White House, was supplemented by other buildings. In 1891 the Trust lost the use of Poor's Land to the London County Council. The asylum reorganised its buildings, demolishing the historic White House and erecting a new block in 1896. This building became the present Bethnal Green Library. A history of Poor's Land and Bethnal House is included in <i>The Green</i> (A.J. Robinson and D.H.B. Chesshyre).</p>\\n<h3>Other houses on the Green</h3>\\n<p>The north end of the Green is associated with the Natt family. During the 18th century they owned many of its houses. Netteswell House is the residence of the curator of the Bethnal Green Museum. It is almost certainly named after the village of Netteswell, near Harlow, whose rector was the Rev. Anthony Natt. A few of its houses have become University settlements. In Victoria Park Square, on the east side of the Green, No.18 has a Tudor well in its cellar.</p>\\n<h2>Globe Town</h2>\\n<h3>History</h3>\\n<p>To the east of Bethnal Green (and west of Bow and north of Stepney Green) lies <b>Globe Town</b>, established from 1800 to provide for the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, operating 20,000 looms in their own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms became idle and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.</p>\\n<h3>Today</h3>\\n<p>Today Globe Town is presented with three globe sculptures situated in three different corners of the town with it town centre called Globe Town Market Square located to the north on Roman Road next to the Cranbooke Estate. The area is home to a large Bangladeshi community. However it is mostly seen outside Globe Town and Bethnal Green as just a part of Bethnal Green and Stepney Green.</p>\\n<h3>Transport</h3>\\n<p>This area as with greater Bethnal Green is served by <i>Bethnal Green</i> as well as <i>Stepney Green</i>. London Buses routes 309 serves the heart of Globe Town with 8, D6 and night route N8 on the north on Roman Road and 25, 205 and N205 on Mile End Road in Stepney Green to the south.</p>\\n<h2>Modern history</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The silk-weaving trade spread eastwards from Spitalfields throughout the 18th century. This attracted many Huguenot and Irish weavers to the district. Large estates of small two story cottages were developed in the west of the area to house them. A downturn in the trade in 1769 led to the Spitalfield Riots, and on 6 December 1769, two weavers accused of 'cutting' were hanged in front of the <i>Salmon and Ball</i> public house.</p>\\n<p>In the 19th century, Bethnal Green remained characterised by its market gardens and by weaving. Having been an area of large houses and gardens as late as the 18th century, by about 1860 Bethnal Green was mainly full of tumbledown old buildings with many families living in each house. By the end of the century, Bethnal Green was one of the poorest slums in London. Jack the Ripper operated at the western end of Bethnal Green and in neighbouring Whitechapel. In 1900, the <i>Old Nichol Street Rookery</i> was demolished, and the Boundary Estate opened on the site near the boundary with Shoreditch. This was the world's first council housing, and brothers Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont were brought up here. In 1909, the Bethnal Green Estate was built with money left by the philanthropist William Richard Sutton which he left for 'modern dwellings and houses for occupation by the poor of London and other towns and populous places in England'.</p>\\n<p>On 3 March 1943 at 8:27PM the unopened Bethnal Green tube station was the site of a wartime disaster. Families had crowded into the underground station due to an air raid siren at 8:17, one of 10 that day. There was a panic at 8:27 coinciding with the sound of an anti-aircraft battery (possibly the recently installed Z battery) being fired at nearby Victoria Park. In the wet, dark conditions the crowd was surging forward towards the shelter when a woman tripped on the stairs, causing many others to fall. Within a few seconds 300 people were crushed into the tiny stairwell, resulting in 173 deaths. Although a report was filed by Eric Linden with the <i>Daily Mail</i>, who witnessed it, it never ran. The story which was reported instead was that there had been a direct hit by a German bomb. The results of the official investigation were not released until 1946. There is now a plaque at the entrance to the tube station which commemorates it as the worst civilian disaster of World War II, and funds are being raised for a memorial. It is estimated that during WWII, 80\\u00a0tons of bombs fell on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. There were a total of 555 people killed and 400 seriously injured. Many unexploded bombs remain in the area, and on Monday 14 May 2007, builders discovered a World War II 1 m long 500\\u00a0lb (230\\u00a0kg) bomb.</p>\\n<p>The book <i>Family and Kinship in East London,</i> based on materials gathered in the 1950s, shows an improvement in working-class life. Husbands in the sample population no longer went out to drink but spent time with the family. As a result, both birth rate and infant death rate fell drastically and local prosperity increased. It is true that the infamous gangsters the Kray twins lived in Bethnal Green in the 1960s. However, by the beginning of the 21st century, Bethnal Green and much of the old East End began to undergo a process of gentrification.</p>\\n<p>The former Bethnal Green Infirmary, later the London County Council Bethnal Green Hospital, stood opposite Cambridge Heath railway station. The hospital closed as a public hospital in the 1970s and was a geriatric hospital under the NHS until the 1980s. Much of the site was developed for housing in the 1990s but the hospital entrance and administration block remains as a listed building. Marcus Garvey was at one time buried here, before his body was returned to Jamaica. The Albion Rooms are located in Bethnal Green where Pete Doherty and Carl Bar\\u00e2t of the Libertines used to live when the band was together. It became part of music history as the band would hold Guerilla Gigs in the flat that would be packed with people.</p>\\n<h2>Geography</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bethnal Green forms a part of Tower Hamlets and Hackney, centred around the Central line tube station at the junction of Bethnal Green Road, Roman Road and Cambridge Heath Road.</p>\\n<p>The district is associated with the E2 postcode district, but this also covers parts of Shoreditch, Haggerston and Cambridge Heath. Between 1986 and 1992, the name <i>Bethnal Green</i> was applied to one of seven neighbourhoods to whom power was devolved from the council. This resulted in replacement of much of the street signage in the area that remains in place. This included parts of both Cambridge Heath and Whitechapel (north of the Whitechapel Road) being more associated with the post code and administrative simplicity than the historic districts.</p>\\n<h2>Demographics</h2>\\n<p>Bethnal Green had a total population of 25,440 at the 2001 census, based on the north and south wards of Bethnal Green. The largest single ethnic group is people of Bangladeshi descent, which constitute 41 per cent of the area's population, every year since 1999 the Baishakhi Mela is celebrated in Weavers Field, Bethnal Green which celebrates the Bengali New Year. The second largest are the White British, constituting 37 per cent of the area's population. Other ethnic groups include Somalis, Black Africans and Black Caribbeans.</p>\\n<h2>Religion</h2>\\n<p>The two main faiths of the people are Islam and Christianity, with 50 per cent Muslim and 34 per cent Christians.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are many historical churches in Bethnal Green. Notable churches include, St John on Bethnal Green, located near the Bethnal Green tube station, on Bethnal Green Road and Roman Road. The church was built from 1826 to 1828 by the architect John Soane. Other notable churches include St Matthew - built by George Dance the Elder in 1746. St Matthew is the mother church of Bethnal Green; the church's opening coincided with a vast population increase in the former village of Stepney, resulting in the need to separate the area around Bethnal Green from the mother Parish of St Dunstan's, Stepney. All but the bell tower, still standing today, was destroyed by fire and the church again suffered devastating damage during the bombing campaigns of the Second World War, resulting in the installation of a temporary church within the bombed-out building. St. Matthew's remains a major beacon of the local East End community and is frequented on Sundays and other religious occasions by a mixture of established locals and more recent migrants to the area.</p>\\n<p>Other churches include St Peter's (1841) and St James-the-Less (1842), both by Lewis Vulliamy, St James the Great by Edward Blore (1843), and St Bartholomew by William Railton (1844). The church attendance in Bethnal Green was 1 in 8 people since 1900, and is estimated around 100 people attend church today (only 10% attend regularly in the UK). Baptisms, marriages and burials have been deposited nearly at all churches in Bethnal Green.</p>\\n<p>There are four Islamic mosques or places of worship in Bethnal Green for the Muslim community. These are the Baitul Aman Mosque and Cultural Centre, Darul Hadis Latifiah, the Senegambian Islamic Cultural Centre and the Globe Town Mosque and Cultural Centre.</p>\\n<p>The London Buddhist Centre, at 51 Roman Road, is one of the largest urban Buddhist centres in the west, and is the focus of a large Buddhist residential and business community in the area.</p>\\n<h2>Education</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bethnal Green has numerous primary schools serving children aged three to 11. St. Matthias School on Bacon Street, off Brick Lane, is over a century old and uses the Seal of the old Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green as its badge and emblem. The school is over a century old but underwent extensive remodelling in 1994 and added a new sports hall on its Granby Street former playground site in 2006. The school is linked with the nearby 18th century St. Matthew's Church on St. Matthew's Row; pupils attend mass and perform seasonal plays and performances at the church and the Parish reverend provides religious instruction at the school. The Bangabandhu Primary School, named after the father of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib, a non-selective state community school, was opened in January 1989, moved to a new building in November 1991, and has over 450 pupils. 70% of the school's pupils speak English as a second language, with a majority speaking Sylheti, a dialect of Bengali, at home, but the Ofsted inspectorate deemed Bangabandhu a \\\"successful and effective school\\\" where pupils \\\"achieve well and make good progress\\\".</p>\\n<p>Bethnal Green's oldest secondary school is Raine's Foundation School, with sites on Old Bethnal Green and Approach roads, a voluntary aided Anglican school founded in 1719. The school relocated several times, amalgamating with St. Jude's School  to become coeducational in 1977. Other schools in the area include Bethnal Green Academy, Oaklands School, and Morpeth School.</p>\\n<p>The V&amp;A Museum of Childhood on Cambridge Heath Road houses the child related objects of the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>\\n<p>The Bethnal Park (also known as Barmey Park) and Bethnal Green Library provide leisure facilities and information.</p>\\n<h2>Transport</h2>\\n<h3>Rail</h3>\\n<p>The nearest station is <i>Bethnal Green</i> for London Underground and <i>Bethnal Green</i> (not to be confused with the Tube station of the same name) next to Whitechapel and <i>Cambridge Heath</i> in Cambridge Heath for National Rail.</p>\\n<h3>Buses</h3>\\n<p>London Buses 8, 26, 48, 55, 106, 254, 309, 388, D3, D6, N8, N55, N253 all operate within the area.</p>\\n<h3>Roads</h3>\\n<p>Bethnal Green is connected to the National Road Network with the north-south Cambridge Heath Road A107 and the A11 in Whitechapel.</p>\\n<h3>Cycling, walking, waterways</h3>\\n<p>The Regent's Canal runs north and west of the area with a towpath running along it next to Victoria Park, London.</p>\\n<h2>Sport and leisure</h2>\\n<p>Bethnal Green has a Non-League football club Bethnal Green United F.C., which plays at Mile End Stadium.</p>\\n<h3>Location</h3>\\n<p><br></p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<ul><li>List of people from Tower Hamlets</li>\\n<li>List of schools in Tower Hamlets</li>\\n<li>Stepney Historical Trust</li>\\n</ul><h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>\\\"Tower Hamlets London Borough Council information about Bethnal Green\\\".

Its original remit was to unite workers and unemployed alike in order to bring to the fore, the lack of affordability of housing in the United Kingdom, social injustice, corporate greed and the influence of companies and lobbyists on government. Thwarted in their original aim to camp outside the London Stock Exchange, a camp was set up nearby next to St Paul's Cathedral. On 18 January 2012 Mr Justice Lindblom granted an injunction against continuation of the protest; but the protesters remained in place pending an appeal. The appeal was refused on 22 February, and just past midnight on 28 February bailiffs supported by City of London police began to remove the tents.</p>\\n<p>The protests began in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, United States, and with support from tax avoidance protest group UK Uncut and the London based contingent of the Spanish 15M movement. In October protesters established two encampments in central London: one outside St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London and the other in Finsbury Square just to the north of the City. In November a third major site was opened in a disused office complex owned by UBS. Named by protesters as the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, the site was located in Hackney until occupiers were evicted in late January 2012. A fourth site was established in late December, at the unused premises of Old Street Magistrates Court in east London. The site's owners objected to its long term use by Occupiers, and agreement was reached for the building to be vacated by the end of January 2012.</p>\\n<p>In February 2012, occupiers were evicted from their main camp in <i>St Paul's</i>, and from the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, leaving <i>Finsbury Square</i> as the last London site to remain occupied. The Finsbury Square camp was itself cleared by authorities in June 2012; several of the occupiers went on to establish a new camp in Shoreditch Park, but only remained there for a few days. While no longer maintaining a major physical occupation, the <i>Occupy London</i> group continue to organise meetings, events and actions.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Chronology</h2>\\n<h3>2011 events</h3>\\n<h4>October</h4>\\n<p>On 10 October 2011 a campaign was launched on Facebook for protests to take place at the London Stock Exchange on 15 October in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York and with multiple other protests planned worldwide for that day.</p>\\n<p>The London Stock Exchange in Paternoster Square was the initial target for the protesters on 15 October. Attempts to occupy the square were thwarted by police. Police sealed off the entrance to the square as it was private property, a High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square. 2,500-3,000 people gathered nearby outside St Paul's Cathedral, with around 250 camping overnight. During the afternoon of 15 October Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, the subject of extradition proceedings by the prosecution authorities of Sweden, gave an impromptu speech to the protesters on the topic of anonymity after he was challenged by police for wearing a mask as he walked to the protest. On the Sunday morning the canon of St. Paul's, Reverend Giles Fraser, asked the police to leave the cathedral steps, saying he was happy for people to \\\"exercise their right to protest peacefully\\\" outside the cathedral.</p>\\n<p>By 17 October an encampment of around 150 tents together with makeshift tarpaulin shelters was clustered around the west side of St Paul's Cathedral. On the 17th the Occupy London protesters issued a nine-point 'Initial Statement' drafted by \\\"an assembly of over 500 people on the steps of St Paul's [Cathedral]\\\". On 21 October, the Dean of St Paul's announced that the cathedral would be closing until further notice as a result of the Occupy London camp pitched outside, and asked the protesters to leave the vicinity of the building \\\"so that the cathedral can reopen as soon as possible\\\". On the evening of the 21st it was reported that the protesters had decided that they would remain in their encampment outside the cathedral, and that they believed that they could not be lawfully removed from the site without a court order.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 22 October the protesters established a second camp in Finsbury Square, just north of the City of London in the London Borough of Islington.</p>\\n<p>On 23 October rock band The Featherz performed a guerilla gig at the St Paul's Cathedral camp as their debut concert.</p>\\n\\n<p>On 26 October it was reported that the Dean of St Paul's had decided that the cathedral would reopen on 28 October, following the resolution of all health and safety concerns. The move was described as an \\\"embarrassing U-turn\\\" by the British national newspaper <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>\\n<p>On 27 October Dr Giles Fraser resigned as Canon Chancellor of St Paul's over disagreements on the handling of the demonstrators, saying \\\"I resigned because I believe that the chapter has set on a course of action that could mean there will be violence in the name of the church.\\\"</p>\\n<p>On 28 October the movement's first set of demands, 'Democratise The City of London Corporation' was published as a first step in the challenging of unaccountable global power elites. The 28th also saw the resignation of the part-time Chaplain of St Paul's Fraser Dyer.</p>\\n<h4>November</h4>\\n<p>On 1 November The Rt Revd Graeme Knowles the Dean of St Paul's resigned following the backlash against his Chapter's resolution to forcibly evict the Occupy London protesters from outside the cathedral. The <i>City of London Corporation</i> proceeded to take legal action against the camp at St Pauls, without support from the Cathedral. Canary Wharf Group took legal action on the 3rd, against protesters attempting to <b>Occupy Docklands</b>.</p>\\n<p>On 18 November, protesters took over a disused office complex owned by the bank <i>UBS</i>, located in the London borough of Hackney. The site was opened to the public the following day as the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, and provides free services including a library, seminars and various discussion related events. On 28 November protesters at the Hackney site said they would contest attempts by lawyers to have them evicted.</p>\\n<p>During the 2011 UK public sector strikes on 30 November, strikers attempted to occupy Panton House in Central London but were challenged by police and subsequently kettled outside the building.</p>\\n<h4>December</h4>\\n\\n<p>In early December the Metropolitan Police added the occupiers to their list of terrorist suspects. On 6 December, members of the bands Radiohead and Massive Attack performed for free at the <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, as part of a Christmas party for the London occupy movement. On 7 December members of occupy met with Hector Sants, the CEO of the Financial Services Authority, to discuss banking reform. The London occupy movement have began to offer sightseeing tours of London to tourists and plan to host further musical events after the success of the gig involving RadioHead and Massive Attack.</p>\\n<p>On 15 December, Jesse Jackson addressed the Occupy camp at St Pauls, saying that Jesus Christ, Gandhi and Martin Luther King were all occupiers, and that: \\\"Occupy is a global spirit, which is now sweeping the nation and the world, fighting for justice for all of God's children\\\". </p>\\n<p>By late December consensus among occupiers at the main camp in St Pauls had seemed to coalesce round a view that is would be better to leave voluntarily as long as they can be allowed to keep a small presence, and negotiations were started to see if agreement could be reached with the Cathedral. Also in late December a fourth site was established in East London at an unused court and police complex. Occupiers announced plans to use the new site to host a symbolic \\\"trial of the 1%\\\"</p>\\n<h3>Overnight occupancy</h3>\\n<p>In the week beginning 24 October 2011 a number of British national newspapers reported that footage from a thermal imaging camera shot by a police helicopter revealed that only around 10% of the tents at the Occupy London camp outside St Paul's were occupied all night. The protesters disputed these claims and the City of London Police later confirmed that neither the details of the thermal imaging cameras nor the occupancy estimates had come from them. Two British national newspapers, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, subsequently videoed the camp using thermal imaging equipment, which they claimed confirmed that only around 10% of the tents were occupied all night.</p>\\n<p>The claims were disputed by the protesters and other journalists, who noted that most protesters did not go to sleep at the time of the day when the images were taken, and thermal imaging produces inaccurate results when used on insulative material like those of the tents. The protesters recorded and published videos using the same thermal camera to demonstrate this, and lodged a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission regarding the claims. They also mentioned that many of them are 'ordinary people with jobs and families' and therefore cannot be present on site at all times.</p>\\n<p>The techniques used by the newspapers were subsequently criticised as \\\"rubbish science\\\" by a military scientist, according to reports in <i>The Guardian</i>, although the source asked to remain anonymous.</p>\\n<p>On 11 November police arrested 170 EDL members on Armistice Day when intelligence revealed EDL members planned to attack campers at St Paul's Cathedral.</p>\\n<h3>2011 statements</h3>\\n<h4>Initial statement</h4>\\n<p>On 16 October, a gathering of over 500 Occupy London protesters collectively agreed upon and issued the following 'Initial Statement':</p>\\n<blockquote class=\\\"templatequote\\\">\\n<ol><li>The current system is unsustainable. It is undemocratic and unjust. We need alternatives; this is where we work towards them.</li>\\n<li>We are of all ethnicities, backgrounds, genders, generations, sexualities dis/abilities and faiths. We stand together with occupations all over the world.</li>\\n<li>We refuse to pay for the banks\\u2019 crisis.</li>\\n<li>We do not accept the cuts as either necessary or inevitable. We demand an end to global tax injustice and our democracy representing corporations instead of the people.</li>\\n<li>We want regulators to be genuinely independent of the industries they regulate.</li>\\n<li>We support the strike on 30 November and the student action on 9 November, and actions to defend our health services, welfare, education and employment, and to stop wars and arms dealing.</li>\\n<li>We want structural change towards authentic global equality. The world\\u2019s resources must go towards caring for people and the planet, not the military, corporate profits or the rich.</li>\\n<li>The present economic system pollutes land, sea and air, is causing massive loss of natural species and environments, and is accelerating humanity towards irreversible climate change. We call for a positive, sustainable economic system that benefits present and future generations.</li>\\n<li>We stand in solidarity with the global oppressed and we call for an end to the actions of our government and others in causing this oppression.\\n\\n</li>\\n</ol></blockquote>\\n<h4>Statement on The City of London Corporation</h4>\\n<p>On Monday 7 November the first set of demands to come out of Occupy London were ratified by the General Assembly at St Paul's Cathedral. Born out of an earlier statement which was praised in the media as an example of how the protestors were sharpening up their act, they aimed to open the City of London Corporation - the local authority for the UK's financial centre - to deeper scrutiny. Those present said that 200 people voted for the document asking the corporation to open itself to freedom of information requests, publish its accounts retrospectively to 2008, and reveal its financial involvements. The statement from the demonstrators also requested the end of business and corporate votes in elections, the removal of \\\"secrecy practices\\\" and the transparent reform of City institutions along with a commission to examine allegations of corruption. Both statements were met with responses from thinkers such as George Monbiot, Nicholas Shaxson and Blue Labour thinker and peer Lord Glasman.</p>\\n<h4>First statement on corporations</h4>\\n<p>On 29 November the Occupy London movement released first statement of demands on corporations, where they called for measures to end tax evasion by wealthy firms.</p>\\n<h3>2012 events</h3>\\n\\n<p>In January 2012, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced his intention to tackle excessive executive pay and crony capitalism, which <i>Financial Times</i> columnist Philip Stephens suggested may be an indication that the PM has signed up to Occupy values.</p>\\n<p>On 18 January, the High court ruled in favour of the <i>City of London Corporation</i>, giving them the power to order the forcible eviction of occupiers from the St Pauls Camp. A spokesperson for the City said they would not further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Pauls camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being a worthwhile cause, it may help the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.</p>\\n<p>On 30 January, occupiers were evicted from the site where they had set up their <i>Bank of Ideas</i>, by bailiffs acting on behalf of UBS, who own the premises.</p>\\n<p>In mid February, Occupy London took over an abandoned school in Islington, which they called the <i>School of Ideas</i>. They were evicted two weeks later, with authorities arranging for the school to be bulldozed on 28 February. Also on 28 February, occupiers and their tents were removed from the area surrounding St. Paul's Cathedral, by a team of bailiffs supported by riot police. The St Pauls site had been the last surviving high profile camp of the worldwide Occupy movement. At the time of its eviction it was also the largest one remaining. According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, Occupy activists insisted that their campaigning would continue, with some displaying banners announcing that the protests so far were \\\"just the beginning.\\\" Comedian Mark Steel compared the efficiency of the police in the clearing of a few tents with their stumbling investigation of News International. \\\"Last year, presumably , if they'd been asked to evict them, they'd have written a report saying: \\\"We have left no stone unturned in pursuing the occupiers, but after driving round the cathedral hundreds of times we have no evidence of any tents anywhere, or indeed of any cathedral.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In April, Bloomberg reported that the St Paul's camp cost London authorities just over a million pounds in monitoring and legal fees, while the Finsbury Square camp had so far cost about \\u00a310,000.</p>\\n<p>Islington Council won a court order to Finsbury Square on 1 June, giving them the authority to perform a forcible eviction. Occupiers tried to establish an alternative camp in Hampstead Heath, but were immediately moved on by the police. Meanwhile other smaller camps emerged in other parts of London, including Leyton Marshes, Wapping and Limehouse. The Finsbury Square camp was evicted in the early hours of 14 June. Some of the occupiers migrated to nearby Shoreditch Park, where they set up their tents. Occupiers have reported mixed views as to whether the new camp was still a political protest. The Evening Standard was told the Shoreditch camp was a temporary base from which to regroup, and that future \\\"high profile\\\" occupations were planned. However other <i>Occupy London</i> supporters suggested that the new camp was no longer a political protest; several of the evicted campers were homeless with nowhere else to go. One activist said it's uncertain whether there will be future physical occupations. By 26 June the <i>Shoreditch Park</i> camp had gone - locals were unsure where to, or even if the campers had chosen to stay together or to disperse.</p>\\n<p>In October, as part of their celebrations to mark their one year anniversary, <i>Occupy London</i> released <i>The Little book of Ideas</i>, a free ebook which aims to explain financial concepts useful in understanding both the 2008 global crisis and ongoing economic inequality. Another event to mark the anniversary involved protestors entering St Paul's Cathedral during a service, to chain themselves to the pulpit. Also in October, they organised a conference at <i>Friends House</i> London, with special guests including Mick McAteer, TUC senior economist Duncan Weldon and Bank of England director Andy Haldane. Haldane told occupiers that they had been correct about inequality being a cause of the financial crisis. He went on to say that Occupy had helped win the debate concerning the need for reform of the financial sector; that they may play a key role in the ongoing reform process; and that: \\\"policy makers, like me, will need your continuing support in delivering that radical change.\\\" According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, this was the first time a senior Central Banker has asserted that Occupy was correct in their analysis of the crisis.</p>\\n<h3>2014 Events</h3>\\n<p>In October of 2014, 50 to 100 protesters occupied Parliament Square for several days. Their goal was \\u201cdirect the energy from current single-issue struggles into a critical mass that can radically challenge the corrupt and unrepresentative system.\\u201d  The camp was established on the 17th of October and the aim was to stay until Sunday the 26th.  However, on the 19th the police unsuccessfully tried to evict the camp. On the 20th around 140 police were part of an operation to remove the tarpaulin the protesters were sitting on. This lead to the Hash-tag tarpaulin revolution. On the 21st police successfully removed the protesters making initially 15 arrests, including Jenny Jones (Green politician) a Green Party Peer.15 more were arrested later as they tried to retake Parliament square. One protester remained in the square based on the Winston Churchill Statue.  He remained there for over 28 hours until being arrested on a number of charges mainly criminal damage.A large number of protesters stayed behind police fencing to continue the vigil.</p>\\n<p>On Thursday the 23rd the organisers staged a show of force. They asked for people to turn up at the green next to the square, where the protest is now based. An extra 300 people arrived to show support. There was a number of speakers present from Ken Loach to the Artist Taxi driver, Mark McGowan (performance artist). After the speeches protesters linked arms and encircled the square during which there was three breaches of the perimeter fence. the protester who had stayed on the Churchill Statue, known only as Dan, was once again arrested on charges of criminal damage, after throwing sausages to police dogs. the total arrests by Thursday was 40, most of which on charges of breaking bylaws. </p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe police have a duty to facilitate peaceful protest in this country which people have a legal right to do, but that appears to end as soon as you come within shouting distance of the Westminster village. The people who run this country should not be able to tuck demonstrators away out of sight. Parliament needs to listen and people should have the right to get their voices heard.\\u201d Jenny Jones</p>\\n<h2>Reaction to Police over-reaction</h2>\\n<p>In early November 2011, Ed Miliband (the UK Leader of the Opposition) said that mainstream politicians should listen to the occupiers, though he also stated that protesters should not be allowed to control the discussion. One worker in a banking software company, David Pinder, responded to the statement: \\\"I think the message is a bit lost because there's no real solutions being offered. It is one thing to say the system doesn't work but I don't hear any alternatives being proposed.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Responding to Jenny's arrest, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett immediately tweeted: \\\"...There are reports that protesters had umbrellas, cash and other items of no conceivable aggressive use confiscated, and that police in large numbers have tried to make their continued presence as physically uncomfortable as possible.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Prime Minister David Cameron was recently rightly speaking up for the rights of free assembly of the people of Hong Kong. He might like to look out his office window and ensure that the same rights are being respected in London.\\\"</p>\\n<h2>See also</h2>\\n<p><b>Related portals:</b></p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n\\n<h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li>Occupy London, activist group homepage</li>\\n<li><i>Bank of Ideas</i> homepage</li>\\n<li>Occupy London gallery in <i>The Guardian</i></li>\\n<li>BBC News - St Paul's camp: Occupy London is 'tourist attraction'</li>\\n</ul>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2422.7,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":1023207,\"title\":\"Herol Graham\",\"text\":\"<p><b>Herol \\\"Bomber\\\" Graham</b> (born 13 September 1959 in Nottingham, England) is generally acknowledged as one of the best British boxers of the post-war era never to have won a world title.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q1548162\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":0}],\"type\":null,\"image\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Shoreditch_Park_in_2008.jpg\",\"title\":\"Shoreditch Park\",\"lon\":-0.087354,\"wikidata\":\"Q7501392\",\"lat\":51.534794,\"pageid\":18826995,\"ns\":0,\"extract\":\"<p><b>Shoreditch Park</b> is an open space in Hoxton, in the London Borough of Hackney.

It lies between Liverpool Street and Mile End stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was opened as part of the long planned Central line eastern extension on 4 December 1946; before that it was used as an air-raid shelter. On 3 March 1943, 173 people were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter.</p>\\n<p>The station is an example of the \\\"New Works Programme 1935 - 1940\\\" style adopted by London Transport for its new tube stations. Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, all show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h2>Wartime disaster</h2>\\n<p>Construction of the Central line's eastern extension was started in the 1930s, and the tunnels were largely complete at the outbreak of the Second World War although rails were not laid. The facilities at Bethnal Green were requisitioned in 1940 at the onset of the first Blitz and administration was assigned to the local authority, the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, under the supervision of the 'Regional Commissioners', the generic name for London civil defence. Heavy air raids began in October and thousands of people took shelter there, often remaining overnight. However, usage of the shelter dwindled in 1941 as the Luftwaffe was redirected away from London and against the Soviet Union. A relative lull occurred although the number of shelterers rose again when retaliatory bombing in response to Royal Air Force raids was expected.</p>\\n<p>This was the case on 3 March 1943, after British media reported a heavy RAF raid on Berlin on the night of 1 March. The air-raid Civil Defence siren sounded at 8:17 pm, triggering a heavy but orderly flow of people down the blacked-out staircase from the street. A middle-aged woman and a child fell over, three steps up from the base and others fell around her, tangled in an immovable mass which grew, as they struggled, to nearly 300 people. Some managed to get free but 173, most of them women and children, were crushed and asphyxiated. Some 60 others were taken to hospital. News of the disaster was withheld for 36 hours and reporting of what had happened was censored, giving rise to allegations of a cover-up. At the end of the war, the Minister of Home Security, Herbert Morrison quoted from a secret report to the effect that there had been a panic, caused by the discharge of anti-aircraft rockets. But other authorities who looked into what had happened disagreed; the Shoreditch Coroner, Mr W R H Heddy said that there was \\\"nothing to suggest any stampede or panic or anything of the kind\\\"; Mr Justice Singleton, summarising his decision in <i>Baker v Bethnal Green Corporation</i>, an action for damages by a bereaved widow \\\"there was nothing in the way of rushing or surging\\\" on the staircase; the Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene, reviewing the lower court's judgement said \\\"it was perfectly well known .. that there had been no panic\\\". Lord Greene also rebuked the Ministry for getting the case to be held in secret.</p>\\n<p>The Baker lawsuit was followed by other claims, resulting in a total payout of nearly \\u00a360,000, the last of which was made in the early 1950s. The secret official report, by a Metropolitan magistrate, Laurence Rivers Dunne, acknowledged that Bethnal Green Council had warned London Civil Defence, in 1941, that the staircase needed a crush barrier to slow down the crowds, but was told that would be a waste of money.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was not until 50\\u00a0years after the disaster that a discreet commemorative plaque was erected at the site.</p>\\n<p>The crush at Bethnal Green is thought to have been the largest single loss of civilian life in the UK in World War II and the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network. The largest number killed by a single wartime bomb was 68 at Balham, though there were many more British civilians killed in single bombing raids.</p>\\n<p>The \\\"Stairway to Heaven Memorial Trust\\\" was established in 2007 to create a memorial to those who died in the disaster. Planning permission has been granted for a memorial in the form of a bronze staircase with 173 points of light, designed by local architects Harry Patticas and Jens Borstlemann.</p>\\n<h3>'TUBE' Art Installation</h3>\\n<p>In November 2013 sound artist Kim Zip  created an installation  commemorating the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster. The work was backed by London's Whitechapel Gallery and promoted as part of the organisation's 'First Thursdays'  initiative for popular art.</p>\\n<p>'TUBE'  exhibited over a period of four weeks in the belfry of Sir John Soane's St John on Bethnal Green Church.

The company was initially based at Islington Studios which were built as a power station for the Great Northern &amp; City Railway it was later converted to studios. Other films were made at Lime Grove and Pinewood Studios. The former Islington studios were demolished in 2002 and flats built on the site in 2004. A London Borough of Hackney historical plaque is attached to the building. The studio is best remembered for the Gainsborough melodramas it produced in the 1940s. </p>\\n<h2>History</h2>\\n<p>Gainsborough was founded in 1924 by Michael Balcon and was a sister company to the Gaumont British from 1927, with Balcon as Director of Production for both studios. Whilst Gaumont-British, based at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush produced the 'quality' pictures, Gainsborough mainly produced 'B' movies and melodramas at its Islington Studios. Both studios used continental film practices, especially those from Germany, with Alfred Hitchcock being encouraged by Balcon\\u2014who had links with UFA\\u2014to study there and make multilingual co-production films with UFA, before the war. In the 1930s, actors Elisabeth Bergner and Conrad Veidt, art director Alfred Junge, cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum and screenwriter/director Berthold Viertel, along with others, joined the two studios.</p>\\n<p>The studio's opening logo was of a lady (Glennis Lorimer) in a Georgian era period costume sitting in an ornate frame, turning and smiling, based on the famous portrait of Sarah Siddons by Gainsborough. The short piece of music was written by Louis Levy and called Gainsborough Minuet.</p>\\n<p>After the departure of Balcon to MGM-British, the Rank Organisation gained an interest in Gainsborough and the studio made such popular films as <i>Oh, Mr Porter!</i> (1937) and Hitchcock's <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> (1938). By 1937, Gaumont-British were in financial crisis, and closed their Lime Grove studios, moving all production to the Islington Poole Street studio. However, the tall factory chimney on the site was considered dangerous in the event of bombing during World War II, and thus Gainsborough Studios were evacuated to Lime Grove for the duration of hostilities.</p>\\n<p>From 1942 to 1946, a series of morally ambivalent costume melodramas was produced by Gainsborough for the domestic market. They were mostly based on recent popular books by female novelists. Prominent titles included the <i>The Man in Grey</i> (1943), <i>Madonna of the Seven Moons</i> (1944), <i>Fanny by Gaslight</i> (1944), <i>The Wicked Lady</i> (1945) and <i>Caravan</i> (1946). The films featured a stable of leading British actors, among them Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, Stewart Granger and Patricia Roc. The studio also made modern-dress comedies and melodramas such as <i>Love Story</i> (1944), <i>Two Thousand Women</i> (1944), <i>Time Flies</i> (starring Tommy Handley, 1944), <i>Bees in Paradise</i> (with Arthur Askey directed by Val Guest, 1944), <i>They Were Sisters</i> (1945), and <i>Easy Money</i> (1948).</p>\\n<p>Subsequent productions, overseen by Betty Box (who at the time was the only major female producer in British cinema), included <i>Miranda</i> (1948) and the Huggett family series with Jack Warner, Kathleen Harrison, and Petula Clark. Unhappy with the performance of the studio, Rank closed it down in early 1949. Production was concentrated at Pinewood Studios. Although at first films continued to be made there under the Gainsborough banner, this quickly stopped and no further Gainsborough films were released after 1951.</p>\\n<h2>Demolition</h2>\\n<p>The Lime Grove site was taken over by the BBC in 1949 and used for TV current affairs and other programmes until it was closed in 1991. The buildings were demolished in the early 90s, and replaced with housing called <i>Gaumont Terrace</i> and <i>Gainsborough Court</i>.</p>\\n<p>The former Islington Studios, in Poole Street, remained largely derelict after their closure in 1951 apart from occasional art performances, including two epic Shakespearean productions by the Almeida Theatre Company, April\\u2013July 2000, directed by Jonathan Kent and starring Ralph Fiennes, and a closing <i>Hitchcock season</i> in October 2003.</p>\\n<p>The buildings began to be cleared in 2002, and apartments named <i>Gainsborough Studios</i> were built on the site in 2004, by architects Munkenbeck and Marshall.</p>\\n<h2>Films</h2>\\n\\n<h2>References and notes</h2>\\n\\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\\n<ul><li>Cook, Pam (ed), <i>Gainsborough Pictures</i> (1997);</li>\\n<li>Harper, Sue, <i>Picturing the Past: the Rise and Fall of the British Costume Film</i> (1994);</li>\\n<li>Harper, Sue, <i>Women in British Cinema</i> (2000).</li>\\n</ul><h2>External links</h2>\\n<ul><li><i>Gainsborough Pictures</i> at the British Film Institute's Screenonline</li>\\n</ul><p></p>\"},{\"dim\":1000,\"dist\":2446.6,\"people\":[{\"pageid\":415149,\"title\":\"Neil Gerrard\",\"text\":\"<p>From 1965 he taught at the Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys, Barnet, leaving in 1968 to take up the position of lecturer in computing at the Hackney College, where he remained until his election to parliament 24 years later.</p>\\n\",\"image\":\"\",\"wikidata\":\"Q6988615\",\"ns\":0,\"text_quality\":1},{\"pageid\":41257653,\"title\":\"Susanna Heron\",\"text\":\"<p>In 1995 Heron completed her first site specific commission 'Slate Frieze', 23 rectangular slabs of engraved slate over a 21m length wall in the Council of the European Union, Brussels.

SPACe was used as a training camp for basketball during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>\\n<p>The college also helps businesses by training their staff and delivering apprenticeships in many industry sectors though its business training division View Training [2]</p>\\n<p>It is home to the Tech City Apprenticeship [3] and the London Technical Fashion Academy [4]</p>\\n<p>The college was originally named Hackney College when it was formed in 1974 by the amalgamation of Hackney and Stoke Newington College of Further Education with those sites of Poplar Technical College that had been established in Hackney. Initially run by Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) and, following that, by Hackney Council, when it was renamed. It is now an independent institution, mainly funded through public funds. For a few years it was known as The Community College Shoreditch but has now reverted to the name Hackney Community College (dating from the process known as \\\"incorporation\\\" in 1993 when it was formed from the merger of Hackney College, Hackney 6th Form Centre and Hackney Adult Education Institute)</p>\\n<p>Hackney College is a co-sponsor of Hackney University Technical College, a new university technical college which is opened in dedicated buildings at the main campus of Hackney College in September 2012.</p>\\n<h2>Previous institutions known as Hackney College</h2>\\n<p>'Hackney College' has also been widely used (by Pevsner and others) to refer specifically to Brooke House, until September 2002 one of the Community College's sites. This has now become BSix Sixth Form College.</p>\\n<p>The modern version of the term should also be distinguished from previous Hackney Colleges:</p>\\n<ul><li>One name for the Dissenting Academy set up by Calvinists in Homerton (in the parish of Hackney) in 1786, also known in various accounts as Homerton Academy, or Homerton College. In these years it attracted some notable students, including William Hazlitt. In 1850 it split into two parts. The teacher training component moved to Cambridge, where it is still known as Homerton College; the theological functions stayed in London as part of the three-college merger that created New College London.</li>\\n</ul><ul><li>One name for the seminary co-founded by George Collison (b. 1772- d. 1847). It was also known as Hackney Academy or Hackney Theological Seminary, or Hackney Itineracy, but became best known as the <b>Hackney College</b> after 1871, a name which stuck even after its 1887 move to Finchley Road, Hampstead. Its principal at about this time was Peter Taylor Forsyth.</li>\\n</ul><p>Both of these merged in 1900, becoming the University of London's first Faculty of Theology. In 1924 this became, by Act of Parliament, a constituent college known as <b>Hackney and New College</b>, the two names by which its disparate buildings throughout north London were commonly known. In 1934 new premises were planned. In 1936, the name of the college was simplified to New College London, harking back to the Congregationalist merger of 1850.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n<ol class=\\\"references\\\"><li id=\\\"cite_note-1\\\"><b>^</b> 'Coward College, Byng Place', Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road &amp; neighbourhood (1949), pp. 91.
