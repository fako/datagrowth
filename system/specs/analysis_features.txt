Quickest way

Support K-Cluster algorithms

Allow for many (automated) Characteristics, which specify how they came into being
Feed a Characteristic to Manifestations


class Charateristic(object):
    label
    data_type (string, value, boolean, data)
    source (auto, manual etc.)
    string
    value
    boolean
    data (do not allocate mem for the text field)


class Culture(object):
    collective (can be None)
    characteristic
    individual_hash


Compare Characteristics cross Collectives and cross community (like fashion collective with 2nd hand collective)
    -> single table query


Quickly build Characteristics from a given Collective
    -> iter all individuals with specified keys that should be characteristics


Easily apply existing Characteristics to Individuals (when adding Individuals with a POST for instance)
    -> query all possible charateristics within collective
    -> add rows for each characteristic if applicable
