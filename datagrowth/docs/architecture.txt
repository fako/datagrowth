Data flows through Data Growth in two phases called the growth phase and the scope phase.
During the growth phase a data set gets created.
During the scope phase it's possible to view data from the set in different ways.
Both phases are configured separately.
This allows data from the growth phase to be useful for many different scopes.


.. rubric:: Growth phase

The growth phase gathers data through the Resources and Processors.
Usually there is some initial input which indicates what data needs to be fetched.
A "growth" is complete once all data for an input is gathered and preprocessed.
After completion of a growth phase additional growth phases may occur.
Data from the completed growth phase may then be the starting point for the next growth phase.

Once a growth is completed the data is stored inside Organisms. There are three types of Organisms:

* Individuals are single data entries consisting of key/value pairs

* Families are groups of Individuals that share the same keys

* Communities are groups of Families and loose Individuals that together make up a coherent data set

In practice you'll declare which data your Community should contain and then you'll "grow" this community.
During growth all data gets gathered and preprocessed into standard entities, which makes it easy to work with it.


.. rubric:: Scope phase

After growth the amount of data inside a Community is often too big to process or view at once.
During the scope phase it is possible to select parts of the data.
This selection could be useful output for somebody.
Or it could just be the input for a training process or other type of data usage.
